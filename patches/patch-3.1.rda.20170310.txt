Purpose: Support build on Mac OS X Sierra
ProofPower version: 3.1w7
Description: Mac OS X Sierra introduced a change in the C libraries
that caused the build of the PPTex package building. The build could also
fail depending on where Poly/ML is installed as a result of incorrect
default options to the polyc script.
Notes: Apply the patch in the usual way, e.g.,

	gunzip -c /tmp/patch-3.1.rda.20170310.diff.gz | patch -p1 -b -B orig/  

and then run the distclean, configure and install scripts.
