\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Scope}
This document gives the detailed design for the Print On Demand versions of the {\Product} user manuals.

\subsection{Purpose and Background}

To suggest a strategy for publication.
To provide the detailed information required for submitting the manuals for publication.
To suggest minor changes to the manuals to make them more suitable for printing.


\section{STRATEGY}

The proposed method for publication is as follows.

The manuals will be published through \emph{createspace}, an Amazon company, and sold
through createspace and amazon web sites.
They will also be distributed through all other createspace distribution channels for which they qualify.

Interior of the published books will be obtained by shrinking the PDF files for the relevant release
of {\Product} to the standard trim size of 8.5 by 11 inches, with the exception of the two reference
manals, which will need to be split into two volumes.
In the case of the reference manuals it is proposed that the second volume will be just the QWIC index
and that some minor changes be made to the manuals to provide a lightweight introduction to
the second volume.

I propose that all the USR documents be published in this manner, and that a new edition
of these be made for every major release of {\Product} with updates to the interior only for each
minor release.

We have the option to make these part of a series.

\begin{quote}
A series is a connected set of books. If this book is part of a series, identify where the book exists in the sequence with a volume number. We only accept volume numbers in numerical format ("1", "2", or "3"). Magazines and journals are also often grouped as a series. Identifying the series helps customers find other books in the series.
\end{quote}

I think that is probably a good idea.
The series would be ``ProofPower Manuals'' or ``ProofPower User Manuals'' (I'm not sure the ``User'' adds much).
It would be natural to use the document reference as the "number in series", extra references would be required
where manuals need to be split for printing.
Alternatively, the number in series need not have any significance.

\section{PROPOSED CONTENT CHANGES}

I suggest the chapter 0 of the manuals be reconsidered with a view to replacing them with
material more appropriate for a book.
One possibility would be to provide instead of chapter 0 a preface giving a brief
description of the book, together with appropriate aknowledgements.

The two reference manuals are at present too large to be published as single
volumes (the limit appears to be 630 pages for the proposed trim size).
The simplest way of achieving this is simply to chop off the keyword index
and put it in a second volume, without ceremony.
Perhaps some words of introduction might be placed at the beginning of the
section.
The first volume would still have an index, the cost of the second volume would
be very modest, and its separation would facilitate its use.

This works for the HOL and Z reference manuals insofar as the resulting page
counts are acceptable.
I don't know whether it is good for DAZ (is there a DAZ reference manual similar
to but bigger than the Z reference manual?).
In any case, we remain close to the limits, and so if the manuals were to
grow significantly another solution would have to be sought.
Perhaps putting the theory listings and related materials in a second volume,
with independeny indexes in the two volumes would be OK.

\section{THE `SIGNATURE'}

The principal purpose of this document is to provide the information over and above
the interior PDF which must be submitted for publication of each volume, in a form
suitable for review in advance of publication.
These document will then facilitate the preparation new editions, permitting the
relevant online forms to be populated by reference to the DTD, using copy and paste
in many places.

This section describes the information which must be supplied for each book.
It provides a pro-forma for the information be supplied.
Subsequent sections will supply the information.

The information in the scope of this document relates to three sections
in the createspace publication process.
The information required for these three sections is as follows:

\begin{description}

\item[Title Information]

This is information which will be permanently associated with the ISBN for the book supplied by createspace.

\begin{description}

\item[Title *]

\item[Subtitle]

\item[Primary Author *]

Prefix

First Name / Initial

Middle Name / Initial

Last Name / Surname *

Suffix

\item[Other Contributions]
Similar information for other kinds of contribution, such as
``index by'', ``prepared for publication by'' or just ``contributions by''.

\item[Series] This book is part of a series (this is a tick box)

\item[Series Title] ProofPower User Manuals

\item[Volume] A number, up to 100. We could make these the same as the nnn in USRnnn. provided we allocated
additional USR references for the separate volumes of the reference manuals.
Alternatively just allocate these sequentially as they are published.

\item[Edition number]

What's this?

A version is a particular edition of a book. Identifying the version number helps readers know whether the book is the original edition, or if it contains updated content. If this is the first time you have published this book, enter the numeral 1. If the book was previously published and the version you are publishing contains significant changes, enter the numeral 2 (and so on).

I suggest we follow the instructions, start at 1 and increment the edition number only if there is some reason for wanting the previous versions
of the manuals to continue to be available in print form, or alternatively, for major releases.

\end{description}

\item[Cover]
This is information to be supplied to the createspace cover creator.
The structure of the information required here depends upon the cover style selected.

\item[Description]
Information used in the marketing of the books.

\begin{description}
\item[Description]
This text appears close to the top of the web page for the book on amazon sites, and also on createspace.com.
\item[BISAC Category/Code]
\item[Author Biography]
This text appears in the web page.
\item[Search Keywords]
Not sure where this goes but presumably it plays a role in determining which searches come upm with the book.

Search keywords can help your title show up on both Amazon.com and search engines.
Pick phrases that you think customers are likely to use when either searching for your title specifically,
or when shopping for products that may be similar in subject matter.

You can add up to five keyword phrases separated by commas.
\end{description}

\end{description}

\subsection{Proformas}

The following tables are for copying into sections below and filling in for each manual:

\paragraph{Title Information}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l p{8cm}|}
\hline
field & content \\
\hline
{\bf Title} &  \\
{\bf Subtitle} &  \\
{\bf Primary Author} &  \\
{\bf Other Contributor} &  \\
{\bf Series} & Yes \\
{\bf Series Title} & ProofPower Manuals\\
{\bf Volume} &  \\
{\bf Edition} &  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Cover}

The cover creator information varies accoring to style, a table
will be provided once the style has been agreed.

\paragraph{Description}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l p{8cm}|}
\hline
field & content \\
\hline
{\bf Description} &  \\
{\bf BISAC Category/Code} &  \\
{\bf Author Bio} &  \\
{\bf Search Keywords} &  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Manual Specifics}

\subsection{List of manuals to be published}

The only manuals I would definitely exclude in the first instance are the tutorial overheads.

There are some which are very small, though probably none too small to be publishable by the
available technology.

The following table shows the USR documents and there current titles and lengths.

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l l l l|}
\hline
ref & title & pp & st\\
\hline
USR001 & ProofPower Document Preparation & 64 & n\\
USR004 & ProofPower HOL Tutorial & 87 & y \\
USR005 & ProofPower DESCRIPTION & 64 & n \\
USR013 & ProofPower HOL Tutorial Notes & 135 & y \\
USR011 & ProofPower Z TUTORIAL & 171 & y \\
USR029 & ProofPower HOL REFERENCE MANUAL & 638 & y \\
USR030 & ProofPower Z REFERENCE MANUAL & 671 & y \\
USR031 & ProofPower Xpp User Guide & 21 & n \\
USR032 & ProofPower SLRP User Guide & 60 & n \\
USR0502 & ProofPower Compliance Tool User Guide & 85 & n \\
USR0503 & ProofPower Compliance Tool Installation and Operation & 17 & n \\
USR0504 & ProofPower Compliance Tool -- Language Description & 104 & n \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{ProofPower USR Documents}
\label{tab:ProofPowerUSRDocuments}
\end{center}
\end{table}

This table provides a proposal for how this material should be orgasnised for printing:

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l l l l|}
\hline
vol & title & content & pp \\
\hline
1 & ProofPower Reference Manual - Part I & USR005, USR029, USR030 & 64+638+671-?/2 \\
2 & ProofPower Reference Manual - Part II & USR005, USR029, USR030 & 64+638+671-?/2 \\
3 & ProofPower Introductory Tutorial & USR004 & 87 \\
4 & ProofPower HOL Tutorial & USR013 & 135 \\
5 & ProofPower Z Tutorial & USR011 & 171 \\
6 & ProofPower Document Preparation & USR001, USR031 & 85 \\
7 & ProofPower SLRP User Guide & USR031 & 60 \\
8 & ProofPower Compliance Tool & USR502, USR503, USR504 & 206 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{ProofPower POD Manuals}
\label{tab:ProofPowerPODManuals}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Some of the changes leading to the proposed POD manuals may be desirable in the USRxxx documents,
a trivial case is consistent capitalisation and the renaming of tutorials,
another possibility is the proposed reorganisation of the ProofPower reference manuals.

\subsection{The Z Reference Manual}

\section{`TEST' POLICY}

After review of inputs for publication (as specified above), the relevant data will be submitted to createspace.
An automatic check will be made of the interiors, and any issues raised will be addressed.
At this point cover images will also be made available for review by Lemma1.

All title information must be correct at this point since it cannot be changed after submission for review by createspace.
The titles are then submitted for review by createspace.
After submission for review, electronic proofs will be available, and it will be possible to print proofs.
It is not anticipated that printed proofs will normally be obtained, but this could be done it it was thought desirable.

If any issues are found in the electronic or printed proofs, or if any late information requiring amendments arises 
then alterations can still be made.
If this is done the amended manuals will have then to be resubmitted for review by createspace.

Once createspace and lemma1 both concur the manuals can be published.

Certain further items of information must be agreed between Lemma1 and its publishing agent at this time,
viz. the channels for publication and the list prices.
However, these can be changed subsequent to publication.
