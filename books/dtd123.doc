\subsection{Changes Forecast}

Changes arising from comments on the proposal.

The following issues to be addressed (among others):

\begin{enumerate}
\item the general strategy
\item the trim size

8.5 by 11 inch is proposed for all but the main reference manuals for which 7.44 x 9 69 is the largest size which works for books over 630 pages.
Smaller sizes possible but the font would then be getting too small.

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{To be resolved before first proofs}

The tile information must be agreed before first proofs.
See section \ref{THE SIGNATURE} for what is required and section


\paragraph{Lemma1 Logo}

It is possible to add a publishers logo on the back cover.
A high resolution image would be required, the gifs on the web site are too low.
The dimensions of the place are 1.25 x .8 inches, but logo of different size could be put in scaling to a height of .8 in amd padding out the width.

\section{INTRODUCTION}\label{INTRODUCTION}

\subsection{Scope}

This document gives the detailed design for the Print On Demand versions of the {\Product} user manuals.

\subsection{Purpose and Background}

To suggest an approach to publication by Print on Demand (POD) of the ProofPower user manuals.
To provide the detailed information required for submitting the manuals for publication.
To suggest minor changes to the manuals to make them more suitable for printing.

\subsection{Approach}

The proposed method for publication is as follows.

The manuals will be published through {\bf create}space, an Amazon company, and sold
through {\bf create}space and amazon web sites.
They may also be distributed through other {\bf create}space distribution channels for which they qualify.

Interior of the published books will be obtained by shrinking the PDF files for the relevant release
of {\Product} to the standard trim size of 8.5 by 11 inches, with the exception of the two reference
manals, which will need to be split into two volumes.
In the case of the reference manuals it is proposed that the second volume will be just the QWIC index
and that some minor changes be made to the manuals to provide a lightweight introduction to
the second volume.

I propose that all the USR documents be published in this manner, and that a new edition
of these be made for every major release of {\Product} with updates to the interior only for each
minor release.

We have the option to make these part of a series.

\begin{quote}
A series is a connected set of books. If this book is part of a series, identify where the book exists in the sequence with a volume number. We only accept volume numbers in numerical format ("1", "2", or "3"). Magazines and journals are also often grouped as a series. Identifying the series helps customers find other books in the series.
\end{quote}

I think that is probably a good idea.
The series would be ``ProofPower Manuals'' or ``ProofPower User Manuals'' (I'm not sure the ``User'' adds much).
It would be natural to use the document reference as the "number in series", extra references would be required
where manuals need to be split for printing.
Alternatively, the number in series need not have any significance.


\section{PROPOSED INTERIOR CHANGES}\label{PROPOSED INTERIOR CHANGES}

It is proposed that in the first instance the manuals be published with no changes,
and that any changes subsequently be implemented in the PDFs issued with ProofPower rather
than by creating a distinct set of PDFs for the printed manuals. except insofar as it may
prove necessary to resize the PDFs to fit the target trim ({\bf Create}Space will do this
automatically but the results are sometimes less satisfactory than prior print-to-file
using adobe acrobat).

The remainder of this section is concerned with alternatives, or with possible subsequent improvements.

Chapter 0 of the manuals might be reconsidered with a view to replacing them with
material more appropriate for a book.
One possibility would be to provide instead of chapter 0 a preface giving a brief
description of the book, together with appropriate aknowledgements.

The two reference manuals are at present too large to be published as single
volumes (the limit appears to be 630 pages for the proposed trim size).
The simplest way of achieving this is simply to chop off the keyword index
and put it in a second volume, without ceremony.
Perhaps some words of introduction might be placed at the beginning of the
section.
The first volume would still have an index, the cost of the second volume would
be very modest, and its separation would facilitate its use.

This works for the HOL and Z reference manuals insofar as the resulting page
counts are acceptable.
I don't know whether it is good for DAZ (is there a DAZ reference manual similar
to but bigger than the Z reference manual?).
In any case, we remain close to the limits, and so if the manuals were to
grow significantly another solution would have to be sought.
Perhaps putting the theory listings and related materials in a second volume,
with independeny indexes in the two volumes would be OK.

\section{THE SIGNATURE}\label{THE SIGNATURE}

The principal purpose of this document is to provide the information over and above
the interior PDF which must be submitted for publication of each volume, in a form
suitable for review in advance of publication.
These document will then facilitate the preparation new editions, permitting the
relevant online forms to be populated by reference to the DTD, using copy and paste
in many places.

\subsection{Required Information}

This section describes the information which must be supplied for each book.
The next section provides pro-formas for the information be supplied.
Section \ref{MANUAL SPECIFICS} will supply the details for each volume to be publised..

The information in the scope of this document relates to three sections
in the {\bf create}space publication process.
The information required for these three sections is as follows:

\begin{description}

\item[Title Information]

This is information which will be permanently associated with the ISBN for the book supplied by {\bf create}space.

\begin{description}

\item[Title *]

\item[Subtitle]

\item[Primary Author *]

Prefix

First Name / Initial

Middle Name / Initial

Last Name / Surname *

Suffix

\item[Other Contributions]
Similar information for other kinds of contribution, such as
``index by'', ``prepared for publication by'' or just ``contributions by''.

\item[Series] This book is part of a series (this is a tick box)

\item[Series Title] ProofPower User Manuals

\item[Volume] A number, up to 100. We could make these the same as the nnn in USRnnn. provided we allocated
additional USR references for the separate volumes of the reference manuals.
Alternatively just allocate these sequentially as they are published.

\item[Edition number]

What's this?

A version is a particular edition of a book. Identifying the version number helps readers know whether the book is the original edition, or if it contains updated content. If this is the first time you have published this book, enter the numeral 1. If the book was previously published and the version you are publishing contains significant changes, enter the numeral 2 (and so on).

I suggest we follow the instructions, start at 1 and increment the edition number only if there is some reason for wanting the previous versions
of the manuals to continue to be available in print form, or alternatively, for major releases.

\end{description}

\item[Cover]
This is information to be supplied to the {\bf create}space cover creator.
The structure of the information required here depends upon the cover style selected.

\item[Description]
Information used in the marketing of the books.

\begin{description}
\item[Description]
This text appears close to the top of the web page for the book on amazon sites, and also on {\bf create}space.com.
\item[BISAC Category/Code]
\item[Author Biography]
This text appears in the web page.
\item[Search Keywords]
Not sure where this goes but presumably it plays a role in determining which searches come upm with the book.

Search keywords can help your title show up on both Amazon.com and search engines.
Pick phrases that you think customers are likely to use when either searching for your title specifically,
or when shopping for products that may be similar in subject matter.

You can add up to five keyword phrases separated by commas.
\end{description}

\end{description}

\subsection{Proformas}

The following tables are for copying into sections below and filling in for each manual:

\paragraph{Title Information}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l p{8cm}|}

{\bf Back Cover Text:} &  \\
{\bf Background Image:} & blackback.jpeg \\
{\bf Font Colour: Rich Black} &  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Notes:

"Peaceful Prairie" is a big field, but selecting a background image replaces that default background leaving
only a general layout.
The proposed background is plain black, where text appears it is in a box which provides a lighter grey background making a black font acceptable.
The spine also has that colour.
Since the only text supplied is the title, the front and back will be plain black except for a large grey box in the bottom half of the front cover in which the title is given.
If text is provided for the back page that will be presented in a similar manner with black text on a grey background.

\begin{center}

{\bf Description} & This is the ProofPower user manual USR\emph{xxx}, \emph{title}, as issued in version {\TargetPPRel},  slightly resized from its intended A4 to fit 8.5 x 11 inch paper.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In the case of manuals greater than 630 pages in length the page size will be reduced to 7.44 x 9.69 inches.
The interior and the description will be updated at each release keeping the available hard copy in sync with the releases.

\section{MANUAL SPECIFICS}\label{MANUAL SPECIFICS}

\subsection{List of manuals to be published}

The only manuals I would definitely exclude in the first instance are the tutorial overheads.

There are some which are very small, though probably none too small to be publishable by the
available technology.

The following table shows the USR documents, their proposed titles (dropping capitalisation and adjusting tutorial names) and current lengths.
The leftmost column indicates a proposed volume-in-series number.
A gap ni the series numbers has been left after each reference manual in case it should ever prove necessary to split the manual over two volumes.
The titles which have been change are those for USR004, 5, 11, 13, 29 and 30.

The \emph{pub} column show whether publication from the existing PDF files appears to be technically
feasible, and is either y for ``yes'', n for ``no'' (only for documents of less than 24 pages),
or s for ``conditional on shrink'',
``Conditional on shrink'' means that the page count exceeds the maximum for the closest to A4 print
size (8.5 x 11 inches), which is 630, but may be publishable by re-printing from the A4 PDF to a PDF at a smaller size using Adobe Acrobat (7.44 by 9.69\" seems to work with a page limit of 828).
Amazon provides a shrink to fit facility which is more sophisticated, but it gives bad results on the first page of our manuals.

\begin{table}[ht]

\end{tabular}
\caption{ProofPower USR Documents}
\label{tab:USRDocuments}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Some of the changes leading to the proposed POD manuals may be desirable in the USRxxx documents,
a trivial case is consistent capitalisation and the renaming of tutorials.
Much of the detail can be changed after electronic proofing, but title informations
which accompany the ISBN registration are frozen at this stage, so the information
in there, notably series title and volume, principal author and other contributors and
book title need to be sorted out before going to proof. 

\paragraph{Title Credits}

Certain credit must, and others may, appear in the title information associated
with the registration of the ISBN.
The credits here are not necessarily the same as credits shown on the cover or the
interior of the book, but are used in the pages used on amazon and {\bf create}space web sites.

It is desirable I think to keep the credits shown here to a moderate number,
which in the case of the ProofPower manuals suggests that not all contributors to
a manual should be listed.

By way of compromise I suggest that the following credits are shown:

\begin{itemize}
\item the principal author (see below)
\item for the 2 reference manuals credit to Roger Stokes for the index
\item for each volume, credit to Roger Jones as ``series editor''
\end{itemize}

A more comprehensive attribution of credit might also list under
``contributions by'' all the contributors to the manual, or perhaps
all who made more than some threshold number of commits.

The following table is compiled using git shortlog to determine the
number of commits, and a certain amount of common sense
(major contributions may be introduced by a single commit,
and the reference manuals are compiled primarily from information
stripped from dtds and therefore a log of the top level document
is misleading as to the origins of the bulk of the material).

The code significance is as follows:
p
\begin{description}
\item[A] Principal Author
\item[a] Author
\item[C] Contributions by
\item[I] Index by
\item[P] Prepared for publication by
\end{description}

The numbers appearing in the table are the number of commits
by the author to the volume.

I have placed the author attributions primarily using my own
guess about who the principle author is.
I doubt that a commit threshold would give a sensible set of
additional contribution credits.
If the threshold were 10 for example, there would be only a
small number of such attributions, but they would include
crediting both Rob Arthan and Roger Jones with contributions
to USR004 which I'm not convinced is warranted.

\section{TEST POLICY}\label{TEST POLICY}

After review of inputs for publication (as specified above), the relevant data will be submitted to {\bf create}space.
An automatic check will be made of the interiors, and any issues raised will be addressed.
At this point cover images will also be made available for review by Lemma1.

All title information must be correct at this point since it cannot be changed after submission for review by {\bf create}space.
The titles are then submitted for review by {\bf create}space.
After submission for review, electronic proofs will be available, and it will be possible to print proofs.
It is not anticipated that printed proofs will normally be obtained, but this could be done it it was thought desirable.

If any issues are found in the electronic or printed proofs, or if any late information requiring amendments arises 
then alterations can still be made.
If this is done the amended manuals will have then to be resubmitted for review by {\bf create}space.

Once {\bf create}space and lemma1 both concur the manuals can be published.

Certain further items of information must be agreed between Lemma1 and its publishing agent at this time,
viz. the channels for publication and the list prices.
However, these can be changed subsequent to publication.
