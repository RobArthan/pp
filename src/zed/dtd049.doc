\subsection{Changes Forecast}

As various parts of the user interface backend are completed, they
will be called from the appropriate recognizers. This will change the
implementation but is unlikely to require changes to this document.

\section{GENERAL}

\subsection{Scope}
The design in this document covers Z paragraphs which comprise
part of the user interface for the Z proof support system
described in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD018}. The development is
carried out according to \cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN007}.

\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Background and Purpose}

Recognizers are required which will recognize a Z paragraph and
call up the appropriate paragraph processing functions to lexically analyse,
parse and type infer those paragraphs.



\subsubsection{Interface}
This document specifies the interface to the Z paragraph recognizers.
The signature for Z paragraphs is provided in section \ref{SIGNATURE}.

\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None Known.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}

The signature for Z paragraphs depends on the type of the input which
the reader/writer produces. This type, $Lex.INPUT$ is
defined in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD015}.

\section{VARIETIES OF Z PARAGRAPH}

The types of Z paragraph which this document covers are
those specified in the concrete syntax \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007}. These
are basic type declarations (given sets), axiomatic descriptions,
constraints, schema definitions, abbreviations, schema references, generic
constants and free type definitions.

The relationship between the types of Z paragraphs and the recognizers
is described below.

{\ShowAllImages
\subsection{Z Axiomatic Box Recognizer}

The Z axiomatic box recognizer recognizes input beginning with
=INLINEFT
``πZAX''
=TEX
and ending with
=TEX
=INLINEFT
``∞''.
=TEX

This recognizer supports axiomatic descriptions described in section 3.2.2
of \cite{Spivey89}.


\subsection{Z Generic Box Recognizer}

The Z generic box recognizer recognizes input beginning with
=INLINEFT
``ù''
=TEX
and ending with
=TEX
=INLINEFT
``à''.
=TEX

This recognizer supports generic constants described in section 3.9.2
of \cite{Spivey89}.
 
\subsection{Z Schema Box Recognizer}

The Z schema box recognizer recognizes input beginning with
=INLINEFT
``ˇ''
=TEX
and ending with
=TEX
=INLINEFT
 ``à''.
=TEX

This recognizer supports schemas (and generic schemas)
described in section 3.2.4 of \cite{Spivey89}.
 
 
\subsection{Z Other Recognizer}

The Z other box recognizer recognizes input beginning with
=INLINEFT
``πZ''
=TEX
and ending with
=TEX
=INLINEFT
 ``∞''.
=TEX


This recognizer supports basic type definitions
(section 3.2.1 of \cite{Spivey89}),
constraints (section 3.2.3), conjectures (not described in \cite{Spivey89},
abbreviation definitions (section 3.2.5) and free type definitions
(section 3.10).
  
\subsection{Z Term Recognizer}

The Z term recognizer recognizes input beginning with
=INLINEFT
``Ò''
=TEX
and ending with
=TEX
=INLINEFT
 ``Æ''.
=TEX

This recognizer supports Z terms which are useful for expressing
parts of Z when doing proof.

\section{RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT SYNTAX}

Each of the recognizers generates one sort of Z abstract paragraph. The
constructors for the paragraphs in abstract syntax are introduced in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD061}. The relationship between the recognizers and
each of these constructors is presented in the table below.

\section{THE SIGNATURE FOR Z PARAGRAPHS} \label{SIGNATURE}

val €Z_reader› : string -> bool -> string -> ReaderWriterSupport.READER_ENV -> (string * bool)
		-> string -> string -> string list -> string list

	val €parainfo_of_z_para› : ZUserInterfaceSupport.Z_PARA -> PARAINFO;
	val €paragraph_const_spec› : (string list * TERM list * TERM) -> THM;
	val €update_theory_db› : ZUserInterfaceSupport.Z_PARA -> unit
	val €update_theory_db_with_parainfo› : PARAINFO -> unit
end (* of signature ZParagraphs *);
=DESCRIBE
The function $update\_theory\_db$ is used by the paragraph processor
to update the theory database with types and constants which are
present in the mapping of the paragraph argument.

The function $update\_theory\_db\_with\_parainfo$ does the same but with a paragraph where the HOL has already been generated.
If this function fails it will attempt to delete any additions to the theory this call to the function made, but it may fail in this attempt.

Note that message 49006 may be raised either as a warning or as an error,
depending on the setting of $z\_allow\_free\_vars\_in\_axioms$.
=FAILURE
49002	?0 is already used as a type name in the current scope
49003	?0 is already used as a global variable name in the current scope
49004	Internal error in Z paragraph processor (?0)
49005	Free type definitions are only allowed when the theory
	z_sequences (or equivalent) is in scope. The following
	global variables are required and are not in scope: ?0
49006	Z Paragraph for ?0 would contain free variable(s) ?1
49007	Unable to undo all of theory additions, because: ?0
49008	Not given any type names with term ?0
=ENDDOC

The function $update\_theory\_db$ supports the re-introduction of Z paragraphs into the
system which introduce constants of a different type to those
already introduced. (For example a user may have changed a paragraph
in a specifiction). $update\_theory\_db$ deletes the types and
constants which have been introduced subsequent to the constant to
be replaced, defines the new type for the constants, and then re-introduces
the types and constants which were deleted.
Any definitions, axioms and theorems introduced subsequent to the constant
are deleted upon confirmation from the user and not re-introduced.

This means that a user can introduce paragraphs (definition before use) and
freely modify and re-introduce paragraphs without the undesirable
effect of deleting constants and types. The
consistency of the current theory is unaffected by this functionality.

=DOC
	(* €z_allow_free_vars_in_axioms› : system control flag; default false *)
=DESCRIBE
This flag controls whether or not any function that saves a Z construct in 
a theory as an axiom may contain free variables.
This is prevented in parsed constructs, by the Z parser, but $update\_theory\_db\_with\_parainfo$ can be used to cause such an effect
if this flag is $true$.
If the flag is $false$ then error 49006 will be raised if the rule is violated,
otherwise a warning, with the same message, will be raised.

signature €ZParagraphRecognizers› = sig
val €z_axbox_recogniser› : string * string * Lex.INPUT list * string -> unit
val €z_genbox_recogniser› : string * string * Lex.INPUT list * string -> unit
val €z_schbox_recogniser› : string * string * Lex.INPUT list * string -> unit
val €z_other_recogniser› : string * string * Lex.INPUT list * string -> unit
val €z_term_recogniser› : string * string * Lex.INPUT list * string -> TERM
end (* of signature ZParagraphRecognizers *);
=DESCRIBE
This structure is the interface to the Z paragraph recognizers. These
are called by the reader/writer when a Z paragraph is encountered, and
their purpose is to permit the user to enter Z paragraphs for type
checking (when the flag $z\_type\_check\_only$ is set to true, or for
purposes of proof.

The structure is open.

=USES
These functions are not intended to be called by the user directly, but
are to be called by the reader/writer indirectly.
=FAILURE
49001	Only terms may appear between the symbols `Ò' and `Æ'
=ENDDOC
=DOC
	(* €standard_z_paras› : system control flag; default true *)
	(* €standard_z_terms› : system control flag; default false *)
=DESCRIBE
These flags control whether or not non-standard Z language features
(such as free variables) are allowed in Z paragraphs and Z terms.
The defaults are that non-standard features are not allowed in paragraphs
but are allowed in terms.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
	(* €standard_z_terms› : system control flag; default true *)
=DESCRIBE
By default the Z type inferrer carries out an optimisation which reduces the space occupied by the types in the translation of a Z term into HOL.
In unusual circumstances, the cost in speed of saving the space may not be justified and this flag may be used to suppress the optimisation.

\section{TEST POLICY}
The tests should follow the standards and guidelines
laid down in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008}.
