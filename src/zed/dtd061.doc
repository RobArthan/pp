\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains the detailed design for the parser for HOL/Z
as required in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD018}.

\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}

This document gives the detailed design for the parser for HOL/Z.
The interface specification is quite simple. The parser is
essentially a complex black box and is implemented using
the SLRP parser generator, see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD017} using a grammar
based on that specified in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007}.

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
The parser is dependent on the Z lexical analyser, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD060},
and on the HOL symbol table, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD020}.
%\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.

\section{DESIGN ISSUES}


\subsection{Diagnostics}
It is a requirement that the parser gives helpful diagnostics
when the grammar recognises an error, and that it aims to point the
user directly to the location of the error.

For the syntax errors in which the input contains a token
which prevents further parsing,
it is sufficient in the Z parser to provide diagnostics
similar to those in HOL, in which the tokens already recognised
are printed out, followed by a marker ``$<?>$'', and the symbol which
was unacceptable.

It is necessary that diagnostic messages reproduce
the user's input verbatim.
One example where care is needed to ensure that this is possibly when
printing out partially parsed input is in function applications:
a function applied to an argument is represented either as a template
e.g., ñ(\_ + \_) (1, 2)®, or with the fixity rule applied; thus
ñ1 + 2®. Other examples are constructs, such as set comprehensions
with optional constituents.

To achieve a precise diagnostic message,
any structural information necessary to reproduce the user's input
needs to be maintained in the data structure which represents a
parsed Z paragraph.
This requires that the grammar be analysed for productions where structural
information might be lost, and that information be recorded in the data
structure for parsed paragraphs.

The BNF grammar which has been chosen accepts a slightly larger language.
Checks are made to ensure that the input lies in
the desired language (extended or standard as determined by user-settable
options). This  allows higher level diagnostics to be
produced. For example, if a predicate is provided in a place where
an expression is expected, then the situation can be explained as such
(rather than having to say that some token or other was not expected).
Care has to be taken, however, to ensure that as much contextual information
is included in the diagnostic report as given in the diagnostics for an
unexpected token.

\subsection{SLR Problems}

It is quite hard to describe the language of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007} with
a grammar which is directly amenable to automatic parser-generation,
and the reference description in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007} uses a number
of features of BS BNF which are not available with SLRP.
To get round the problems we use two standard compiler-writer's tricks:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
For constructs where the reference description imposes restrictions which
are hard to describe using the available tools one uses a grammar for
a superset of the language and makes checks that the input  is in
the language during a second phase of parsing.
An example of this arise from the $DecName$/$VarName$ distinction in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007} which goes against the grain of the usual treatment
of bracketing.
\item
For constructs where the reference description makes short range contextual
distinctions in the BNF, again one uses a superset and during a second phase of
parsing, one transforms the parse tree to reflect the context. An example
of this arises from the need to distinguish generic instantiations
from horizontal schemas in certain contexts.
\end{enumerate}

The nature of the checks is such that the parser must be organised
in two phases, a context-free parse in phase 1 and a trawl to implement
the above tricks in phase 2. This organisation is, in fact, internal
to the parser and is not visible at its user interface. However, it does
mean that the user will see slightly different styles of error message
in the two different phases. This is currently felt to be not inappropriate,
since the phase 2 errors are, in some sense, higher level errors than those
of phase 1.

The checks and transformations which are required are described alongside
the affected productions and a check-list of them is given in section
TBA (for now see phase 2 of the parser implementation in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP061}).

\section{GRAMMAR}

The grammar of  \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007} requires some recasting
for use in the parser. This section contains the actual form
for processing with $SLRP$ and inclusion in the implementation.
We include reduction functions for use in the implementation.
These have mnemonic names relating to the grammar rules in which
they appear in order to make the grammar easier to change when necessary.

The main differences in the grammar is the  widening of the grammar for
$Expr1$ to allow its re-use (possibly with some extra checks) in
all places in the grammar where applied use
of something approximately like a fancy-fix expression is called for.
In more detail this works out as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
We identify 8 lexical classes for identifiers used to form
fancy-fix expressions, as follows (where \ldots\ stands for
a non-empty part of the expression)

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
Class & Position in Expression \\\hline
$InOp$		&	\_ $Id: dtd061.doc,v 1.32 2005/08/01 14:11:34 rda Exp $ \_			\\\hline
$PostOp$	&	\_ $Id: dtd061.doc,v 1.32 2005/08/01 14:11:34 rda Exp $				\\\hline
$PreOp$		&	$Id: dtd061.doc,v 1.32 2005/08/01 14:11:34 rda Exp $ \_				\\\hline
$BeginOp$	&	$Id: dtd061.doc,v 1.32 2005/08/01 14:11:34 rda Exp $ \_ \ldots			\\\hline
$PostBeginOp$	&	\_ $Id: dtd061.doc,v 1.32 2005/08/01 14:11:34 rda Exp $ \_ \ldots		\\\hline
$ThenOp$	&	\ldots\ \_ $Id: dtd061.doc,v 1.32 2005/08/01 14:11:34 rda Exp $ \_ \ldots	\\\hline
$EndOp$		&	\ldots\ \_ $Id: dtd061.doc,v 1.32 2005/08/01 14:11:34 rda Exp $			\\\hline
$PreEndOp$	&	\ldots\ \_ $Id: dtd061.doc,v 1.32 2005/08/01 14:11:34 rda Exp $ \_		\\\hline
\end{tabular}

\item
In the fixity paragraph, we give a simple SLR(1) grammar for templates
equivalent to that of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007}. This grammar just
uses the terminal $Id: dtd061.doc,v 1.32 2005/08/01 14:11:34 rda Exp $ for the constituent identifiers. The parser
suppresses the classification of identifiers as $InOp$ etc. while it
is processing fixity paragraphs and then after making the required
uniqueness checks uses the information in the fixity paragraphs
to update the tables in which the classification information is held.
\item
The six places in the grammar of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007} in which
fancy-fix forms occur, namely $DefLhs$, $Branch$, $Pred4$, $Expr1$,
$VarName$ and $DecName$.
are handled uniformly by re-using the $Expr1$ syntax, widened to
allow both argument place-holders and actual arguments to appear.
The parser then checks at the point of use whether the $Expr1$ has
the correct form.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Paragraphs}
We map the terms, given sets and constraints of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007}
onto a single nonterminal, $GeneralTerm$. This is done because of
SLR(1) problems right at the other end of the grammar in
$Expr4$.
This enables one parser to handle all of the requirements for parsing Z.

=TEX
\subsubsection{Fixity Paragraph}

Several points are to be noted in these productions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The generic template $GTemplate$ and $Template$ of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007}
are
commoned up in this production.
\item
The $rel$ option does not have a numeric precedence parameter. This
is not the case in the production, and a subsequent
check is required.
\item
We anticipate that early on in the parsing process the parser will
look at the first token of the paragraph and, if it is `$fun$',
`$gen$' or `$rel$', the parser will arrange for all non-reserved identifiers
to be classified as $Id: dtd061.doc,v 1.32 2005/08/01 14:11:34 rda Exp $ (rather than $PreOp$ etc.).
The parser will then check after parsing that the uniqueness rules
for each template are satisfied.
\item
The forms of template containing decoration are not allowed in
a fixity paragraph.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Given Set Definition, Constraint and Term}
$Expr4$ q.v. has been widened to allow a $Pred$ to begin
with a generic formal parameter list. This should only be allowed at
the outermost level, and then the resulting $Pred$ is either a generic one
or if it consists of a single generic formal parameter list it must
be a given set definition.

=DUMPMORE dtd061.grm.txt
ÛGeneralTermÝ	= Pred					(red_pred x1 stk)
			| Pred, `Ampersand`, Pred		(red_pred_constraint x1 x2 x3 stk);
=TEX
Note that in the second two forms the first $Pred$ has to be a given
set definition and that these forms are only allowed when the
$GeneralTerm$ is serving as a constraint.

A $GeneralTerm$ used as a term is distinguished by the use of 
the Z Quine corners to delimit it.
=TEX
\subsubsection{Abbreviation Definition}
=DUMPMORE dtd061.grm.txt
ÛAbbDefÝ		= EqDef						(red_eq_def x1 stk)

					(red_schema x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 stk)

					(red_schema_no_pred x1 x2 x3 x4 stk);

ÛEqDefÝ			= DefLhs, `EqHat`, Pred		(red_deflhs_pred x1 x2 x3 stk);
=TEX
We take the meat of a $DefLhs$ just as $Expr1$. It is required that the expression
be a simple variable or a possibly fancy-fix
generic instantiation thereof.
=DUMPMORE dtd061.grm.txt
ÛDefLhsÝ		= Expr1				(red_expr1_as_def_lhs x1 stk);
=TEX
\subsubsection{FreeType Definition}
We take $Branches$ to be a `$\vert$' separated list of $Expr1$s.

Here the $Expr1$s on the left of
the `$::=$' are the $DecName$s of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007}.

ÛBranchesÝ		= Pred						(red_pred_as_branch x1 stk)
			| Pred, `Bar`, Branches			(red_branches x1 x2 x3 stk);
=TEX
\subsection{Axiomatic box}
=DUMPMORE dtd061.grm.txt
ÛAxBoxÝ		= `Ax`, Decl

			| `Ax`, `LSqBrk`, SomeExprs, `RSqBrk`, `Bars`, Decl, `St`, Pred
					(red_gen_ax_box x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x8 stk);
=TEX
\subsection{Conjecture}
As with constraint we just use $Pred$ for the notion of a possibly generic term:
=DUMPMORE dtd061.grm.txt
ÛConjectureÝ		= `TurnStile`, Pred
					(red_no_id_conjecture x1 x2 stk)
			| Id, `TurnStile`, Pred	
					(red_id_conjecture x1 x2 x3 stk);
=TEX
\section{PREDICATES, SCHEMAS AND EXPRESSIONS}
\subsection{Discussion}
The constructs containing quantifiers or logical
operators create a problem because with them the context
determines whether they are schema forms or predicate forms.

The issue here is that some contexts require predicates, some require
expressions and others may permit either depending on outer context.
A schema expression will serve as either a predicate or an expression.
However, a construct formed with quantifiers or logical operators (which we
assume is taken to be a predicate by default) needs recasting
where an expression is required.
Wherever relevant in the grammar which follows we state what the
contextual rules which enable these distinctions to be made.

The main difference between Z and extended Z is that extended Z also permits
predicates as expressions and vice versa.
Thus the contextual rules mentioned in the previous paragraph are not
enforced for extended Z.
Since the contextual distinction evaporates,
some way is needed to provide a context
in which a schema expression formed with quantifiers or logical operators
is required. Such a context is supplied by the `º' operator, for which
the left-hand operator is taken to be in a context in which the rules
of standard Z apply (to the quantifiers and/or logical operations at
the top levels). 
For example, in standard Z:

=GFT Standard Z Examples
ñA ± B®					is a predicate conjunction
ñµA | a = a · B®				is a predicate quantifier
ñ[x:A ± B | x.c = 1]®				contains a schema conjunction
=TEX

However, in extended Z:

=GFT Extended Z Examples
ñ(A ± B)  {true}®				contains a predicate conjunction
ñ(µA | a = a · B) º [A; B]®			contains a schema quantifier
ñ[A ± B ² C ¤ D] º [A; B; C; D]®		contains no predicate logical operators
ñ(A ± [B | C ± D] º [A; B]®			contains both sorts of conjunction
=TEX
The point in the last example is that the local reversion to standard
Z to the left of the `º' does not apply to the conjunction nested inside
the horizontal schema but only to the outermost logical operators and/or
quantifiers.
\subsection{Predicates and Schemas}
In a $Pred$ the $Pred1$s are contexts requiring predicates.
=DUMPMORE dtd061.grm.txt
ÛPredÝ			= Pred1				(red_pred1_as_pred x1 stk)
			| Pred1, `Semi`, Pred			(red_pred_semi_pred x1 x2 x3 stk);
=TEX
$Pred1$, $Pred2$ and $Pred2$ cater for both schemas and predicates.

In a $Pred1$, the constituent $Pred1$s and $Pred2$ are contexts
where either expressions or predicates are allowed.

=DUMPMORE dtd061.grm.txt
ÛPred1Ý			= Pred2				(red_pred2_as_pred1 x1 stk)
			| Quant, Decl, `Bar`, Pred, `Spot`, Pred1
					(red_quant x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 stk)
			| Quant, Decl, `Spot`, Pred1
					(red_quant_no_bar x1 x2 x3 x4 stk)
			| `Let`, LetDefs, `Spot`, Pred1	(red_let x1 x2 x3 x4 stk);
=TEX
In the following it seems reasonably safe to reuse the reduction functions used for binding displays.
We need a separate production for $LetDef$ with a $Pred1$ rather than a $Pred$ because otherwise the semicolon would be ambiguous (could be a low-precedence conjunction).
=DUMPMORE dtd061.grm.txt
ÛLetDefÝ			= DefLhs, `EqHat`, Pred1		(red_deflhs_pred x1 x2 x3 stk);
ÛLetDefsÝ		= LetDef				(red_eq_def_as_eq_defs x1 stk)
			| LetDef, `Semi`, LetDefs			(red_eq_defs x1 x2 x3 stk);
=TEX
In the first two alternatives for $Pred2$, the constituent $Pred2$s and $Pred3$ are contexts
where either expressions or predicates are allowed.
In the third alternative only expressions are allowed.
(We bundle the non-logical schema operators in here, since they have lower precedence than
the logical ones.)
=DUMPMORE dtd061.grm.txt
ÛPred2Ý			= Pred3				(red_pred3_as_pred2 x1 stk)
			| Pred2, LogInOp, Pred2		(red_log_in_op x1 x2 x3 stk)
			| Pred2, SchInOp, Pred2		(red_sch_in_op x1  x2 x3 stk);
=TEX
In a $Pred3$, the constituent $Schema3$s and $Pred3$ are contexts
where either expressions or predicates are allowed.

=DUMPMORE dtd061.grm.txt
ÛPred3Ý			= Schema3				(red_schema2_as_pred3 x1 stk)
			| `Not`, Pred3				(red_neg x1 x2 stk);
=TEX

As in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007},
we assume that equality and membership are classified as $InRel$s, so that
they do not need a production of their own but just fall under the
appropriate alternative of $Expr1$, q.v.
\subsection{Schemas}

=TEX
In the first sort of $Schema3$, the constituent $Schema4$ is a context where an
expression or predicate is allowed. In the second sort of $Schema3$
the constituent $Schema3$s are contexts where only an expression is allowed.
=DUMPMORE dtd061.grm.txt
ÛSchema3Ý		= Schema4				(red_schema4_as_schema3 x1 stk)
			| SchPreOp, Schema3			(red_sch_pre_op x1 x2 stk);
=TEX
$SchPreOp$ comprises the prefix special purpose schema operators:

In the first sort of $Schema4$, the constituent $Expr$ is a context where an
expression or predicate is allowed. In the other sorts of $Schema4$
the constituent $Schema4$s are contexts where only an expression is allowed.

The renaming operation is another source of SLR(1) parsing problems
(which arise from the use of square brackets for lots of different
purposes).
It is handled here by taking $RenameList$ as one of the options for
$Expr4$. The parser must check that the position in the expression
of any $RenameList$s agrees with the grammar of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007}
and then move them out to their proper position.
=DUMPMORE dtd061.grm.txt
ÛSchema4Ý		= Expr0				(red_expr0_as_schema4 x1 stk)
			| Schema4, `BackSlash`, `LBrk`, SomeExprs, `RBrk`
					(red_schema_hiding x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 stk);

ÛRenameListÝ		= `LSqBrk`, Renames, `RSqBrk`
					(red_rename_list x1 x2 x3 stk);

ÛRenamesÝ		= Expr1, `Slash`, Expr1		(red_rename x1 x2 x3 stk)
			| Expr1, `Slash`, Expr1, `Comma`, Renames
					(red_renames x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 stk);
=TEX
\subsection{Declaration}
In order to allow a declaration which does not
comprise just one schema-as-declaration
to be detected (e.g. in set comprehensions), we rework
the grammar of $Decl$.
=DUMPMORE dtd061.grm.txt
ÛDeclÝ			= DeclMinusPred			(red_decl_minus_pred x1 stk)
			| SomeExprs				(red_pred1_as_decl x1 stk);
=TEX
=DUMPMORE dtd061.grm.txt
ÛDeclMinusPredÝ	= DeclSemi, SomeExprs, `Colon`, Pred1
					(red_decl_semi_var_decs_pred1 x1 x2 x3 x4 stk)
			| DeclSemi, SomeExprs
					(red_decl_semi_pred1 x1 x2 stk)
			| SomeExprs, `Colon`, Pred1
					(red_var_decs_pred1 x1 x2 x3 stk);


ÛDeclSemiÝ		= SomeExprs, `Colon`, Pred1, `Semi`
					(red_var_decs_pred1_semi x1 x2 x3 x4 stk)
			| SomeExprs, `Semi`				(red_pred1_as_decl_semi x1 x2 stk)
			| DeclSemi, SomeExprs, `Colon`, Pred1, `Semi`
					(red_decl_semi_var_decs_pred1_semi x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 stk)
			| DeclSemi, SomeExprs, `Semi`
					(red_decl_semi_pred1_semi x1 x2 x3 stk);
=TEX
\subsection{Expressions}
In the first sort of $Expr0$, the constituent $Expr1$ is a context where an
expression or predicate is allowed. In the other sorts of $Expr0$
the constituent $Expr0$s are contexts where only an expression is allowed.

=DUMPMORE dtd061.grm.txt
ÛExpr0Ý			= Expr1				(red_expr1_as_expr0 x1 stk)
			| MuLambda, Decl, `Spot`, Expr0
					(red_mu_lambda_no_pred x1 x2 x3 x4 stk)
			| MuLambda, Decl, `Bar`, Pred, `Spot`, Expr0
					(red_mu_lambda x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 stk);
=TEX
=DUMPMORE dtd061.grm.txt
ÛEqDefsÝ		= EqDef				(red_eq_def_as_eq_defs x1 stk)
			| EqDef, `Comma`, EqDefs			(red_eq_defs x1 x2 x3 stk);
=TEX

Note that while cartesian product looks like a binary operator here,
it is actually a family of $n$-ary operations. one for each $n ¾ 2$.

In the first sort of $Expr1$, the constituent $Expr2$ is a context where an
expression or predicate is allowed. In the other sorts of $Schema4$
the constituent $Expr1$s are contexts where only an expression is allowed.
The resulting $Expr1$ is an expression unless the template matching
the $Expr1$ comes from a `$rel$' fixity paragraph in which case it
is a predicate.

the constituent $Expr3$s and $Expr4$s are contexts

The parser is expected to move decoration at the end of the Ê-form
out into the abstract Ê-construct. Note it must distinguish
=INLINEFT
Ê(x')
=TEX
\ from
=INLINEFT
Ê(x)'
=TEX
\ etc.
We have to expand the rule for $VarName$ to get an LR(1) grammar.

In the form with  `$Dot$' the $Expr4$ must be an identifier or a numeric
literal.

In an $Expr4$, any constituent $Pred1$s are contexts in which
only an expression is allowed.
The $Pred$ in the third sort of $Expr4$ is a context where an expression
or a predicate is allowed.
Any $Pred$s immediately after `$\vert'$s in an $Expr4$ are contexts
where only a predicate is allowed.

The form comprising an expression list in square brackets is intended
for generic parameter lists (which also serve for generic constraints
and conjectures and for given set definitions).

In the form which covers $Pred$ in brackets and tuple displays,
the initial $Pred$ must actually be a $Pred1$ if it is a tuple display.

The binding display has been omitted for the time being since there
is currently some disagreement about its format.

\section{CHECKS AND TRANSFORMATIONS}
This section gives a check list of the checks and transformations
required to transform a sentence of the language $Specification$ as defined
in this document into a sentence of the language of the same name defined in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007}.

=DOC
signature ÛZParserÝ = sig
val Ûz_parserÝ : {is_quot : bool} -> ZLex.Z_TOKEN list -> ZUserInterfaceSupport.Z_PARA;

structure ÛZParserInternalsÝ : sig
	val Ûz_parser_pass_1Ý : ZLex.Z_TOKEN list -> ZUserInterfaceSupport.PARAGRAPH;
	val Ûz_parser_pass_2Ý : {is_quot : bool} ->
			ZUserInterfaceSupport.PARAGRAPH -> ZUserInterfaceSupport.Z_PARA;
end (* of structure ZParserInternals *);
end (* of signature ZParser *);
=DESCRIBE
This is the context-free parser for Z. It maps the lists of
tokens output by the lexical analyser onto the datatype used as input
to the type inferrer.

Parsing takes place in two passes, the second of which implements various disambiguation rules (e.g., distinction between expressions and predicates).
For the convenience of the developer of applications involving Z embedded in other languages, the two passes are made visible separately in the structure $ZParserInternals$.

If an error is detected in the parsed input
error message 61001 is printed out.
The insert in message 61001 comprises the tokens up to and including
the one at which the error was detected.
The string `$<?>$' is placed in the insert just before the last token to
highlight it.
Note that in the case of an invalid local definition the `$<?>$' is
printed just after the failing $let$-term, since the check is not made
until the entire $let$-term has been read.
After this first line is printed one of message 61003 or 61004 is printed with
appropriate inserts and
error 61000 is raised.

Messages 61005, 61006 and 61007 indicate
an error in the parser itself.
