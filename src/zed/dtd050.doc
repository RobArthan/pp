\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains the detailed design for the 
Z constant generation mechanism for
the Z Proof Support System (see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD015}).
This is called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD017}.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP050}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
In the Z Proof Support Subsystem, two types of constants have been identified:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
 Constants defined as primitive  in the system, see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD052}.
\item 
Constants that belong to infinite families and thus cannot be defined as primitive. 
\end{enumerate}
This document gives the detailed design for the generation of constants of type (2). These constants are defined dynamically on initial introduction and stored in theory ??? at the top of the user hierarchy. A detailed discussion of data storage of dynamically generated constants may be found in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD017}.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
The functions in this document are dependent on the Release 1 HOL System.

\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
\section{ERROR REPORTING}
\section{INFIX DIRECTIVES}
A Standard ML $infix$ command must be given at the `top level'.
Thus we give the commands here for those functions declared in the following signatures.
=TEX
=TEX
\section{SIGNATURE}
=DOC
signature âZConstantsá = sig
=DESCRIBE
The functions which define the Z semantic constants are packaged into this signature.
=ENDDOC
\section{BINDING TYPE DEFINITION}
=DOC
val âbinding_type_defná : TYPE -> TERM * TERM list;
=DESCRIBE
The function which takes a binding type  and yields the  the binding constructor  and a list of binding projections.
The binding constructor  and binding projections are type instantiated before being returned. 

$binding\_type\_defn$ is used in all the following functions which define the Z semantic constants.
=FAILURE
50001	?0 is not a binding type
=ENDDOC
Do we need constructors $mk\_binding\_type\_construction\_defn$ and $mk\_binding\_type\_projection\_defn$ ? 

\section{Z CONSTANT DEFINITION GENERATION FUNCTIONS}
In \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD017} the issue of defining members of infinite families of constants is discussed. The first time such a constant is introduced, its definition is dynamically generated and stored in the theory ???. A polymorhic type definition of the constant is actually stored, which is type instantiated before being returned. If the definition of a constant already exists in the theory, then that definition, type instantiated, is returned.
