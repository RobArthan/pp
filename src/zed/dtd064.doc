\subsection{Changes Forecast} \label{ChangesForecast}

Provide proper support for the outermost parts of a Z~term, so that the
various Z~paragraph forms are properly formatted.  This may require new
facilities in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD031}

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Scope}

This document contains the detailed design for the pretty printer of
the Z proof support system.  The high-level design for this document
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD018}.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Introduction}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Dependencies}

The Z pretty printer uses the facilities offered by the
pretty printing support systems~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD024,DS/FMU/IED/DTD031}.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Interface}

Thew Z pretty printer is accesses via the pretty printing
routines of~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD025}.

\section{TEST POLICY}

A statement of the general principle of testing to be adopted is given
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008}.

The pretty printer tests are oriented to the Z~concrete syntax, they
will exercise all of the clauses in the Z~concrete syntax
of~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007} and will contain a large number of nested
clauses.  The bracket elimination code must be carefully tested to
ensure that all the necessary brackets are present.  This will be done
by creating many~Z terms, formatting them into a string using the
pretty printer, parsing these strings back to form new terms and
testing that they are the same as the originals.
