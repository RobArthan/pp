\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains the detailed design for the theory lister module for
\ProductZ.
The high level design for this material is given in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD018}.

\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
As identified in the high-level design document,
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD018}, the user of the
\ProductZ\ option needs a means of listing out the contents of a theory in Z.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
The implementation of the detailed design
given in this document is dependent on \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP041}.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
It is certainly possible, though not recommended except for the expert,
to load a mixture of \ProductHOL\ and \ProductZ\ paragraphs and declarations
into a theory. The theory lister for Z described here will not display
either the arity of the HOL types or the syntactic declarations for
HOL (aliases, terminators etc.). It might be beneficial to add in something
which would, at least, report on the presence of such things which need to
be inspected using the HOL theory lister. However, since ordinary users
should be advised not to mix languages in this way, it has not been felt
worthwhile to complicate the design and implementation to support such
activity. 
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
Like the HOL theory lister, the theory lister specified here does not
display information about the writability of the theory (i.e. whether it is
locked, or in an ancestor hierarchy).

\section{DISCUSSION}
\subsection{Information to be Listed}\label{InfoToList}
As described in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD018,DS/FMU/IED/DTD049,DS/FMU/IED/DTD079,DS/FMU/IED/DTD103},
a \Product\ theory is used for \ProductZ\
as a container for the following information about the Z paragraphs which
have been loaded into the theory
(these paragraphs are referred to hereafter as the {\em specification}):

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Arity 0 type environment ($ty\_env$)
entries for each of the given sets in the specification
\item
Constant environment ($con\_env$)  entries for each of the global variables
of the specification
\item
Axiom ($axiom\_dict$) and definition ($defn\_dict$)
entries capturing the logical content of certain
paragraphs of the specification.
\item
Theorems ($thm\_dict$) entries for any theorems which have been saved in
the theory.
\item
User data ($user\_data$) entries representing the fixity information
from any fixity paragraphs in the specification.
\item
User data ($user\_data$) entries capturing each conjecture paragraph in the specification.
\end{enumerate}

The names $ty\_env$ etc. in the above refer to the data type
$THEORY$ of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD006}.

It is the Z theory lister's aim to present the above information in
a form which is convenient for the Z user.

Since each given set corresponds both to a type environment entry and
a constant environment entry, there is little point in listing the
type environment entries since their information content is nugatory.

For each global variable, we need to display a representation of its type
to the user. The natural way to do this is to present a Z term co-extensive
with the type (after the fashion of $z\_type\_of\_term$).
This is not sufficient for generic global variables, since their HOL type
is a function space type and these cannot conveniently be represented in Z.
A simple and adequate solution is to present the generic global variable
instantiated to the formal parameters used in its definition and
to present the type of that in terms of the formal parameters.

The axioms and definitions are represented, according to the conventions
of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD049}, in a form which is not in the image of
the Z mapping. Therefore in order to present them in Z, we must apply
an appropriate inference rule, in a similar fashion to $z\_get\_spec$.

The theorems and conjectures will be in the form the
user wants to see and need no special transformation.

It is natural to present the fixity information in a form similar to Z fixity
declarations. For convenience, the fixity declarations should be grouped
together as far a possible. The interfaces of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD079}
are available to protect the theory lister code from the details
of the representation of fixity information as $user\_data$ entries.

In addition to the above information which is, in a sense, local to the
theory, the user will also wish to see the names of the
parent theories and of any child theories.

\subsection{Interface with \TeX}

This is exactly the same
as for the HOL theory lister of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD033}.

\subsection{User Interface}
It is desirable for the interface to be uniform, both as regards layout
and i/o behaviour, with the HOL theory lister of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD033}.
The generic interface of that document makes this fairly straightforward
to achieve.

Thus, there are to be three listing functions:

\begin{description}
\item[$z\_print\_theory$] to display the listing on the standard output;
\item[$z\_output\_theory$] to write the listing to a file in a form suitable
for processing with $doctex$ and $texdvi$;
\item[$z\_output\_theory1$] to write the listing to a file in the same format
as it is written to the standard output by $z\_print\_theory$.
\end{description}
\subsection{Listing Format}

The previous two sections suggest the following
organisation of the theory listing.

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{4in}|}\hline
Section & Contents \\\hline
Parents & names of parent theories \\\hline
Children & names of child theories \\\hline
Global Variables & names of the global variables together with a Z representation
of their type as discussed in section \ref{InfoToList} above \\\hline
Fixity & fixity paragraphs representing the fixity information in the theory\\\hline
Axioms & the axioms converted into Z as discussed in section \ref{InfoToList} above \\\hline
Definitions & the definitions converted into Z as discussed in section \ref{InfoToList} above \\\hline
Conjectures & the conjectures \\\hline
Theorems & the theorems \\\hline
\end{tabular}


Just as in the HOL theory listing: a banner line containing the theory
name appears at the beginning of the listing; 
each section is preceded by a header indicating what is to follow;
sections in which there is nothing to be listed will be omitted; and
the end of the listing is marked by a trailer line (which like the banner
contains the theory name).
Note that the default sieveview file suppresses the trailer
line in the \LaTeX\ form of the listing, but a user could override this
if desired.

The parents, children and theorems sections (and the banner and trailer)
are implemented by reusing the code which does the same job in the HOL theory
lister. The axioms, definitions and conjectures sections are layed out in the same
form as the theorems section; in particular, each axiom or definition is labelled
with the list of its keys.


The fixity section is organised into subsections according to the fixity class
and precedence, and the fixity paragraphs may conveniently be layed out in
the same sort of tabular format as is used for the fixity sections of
a Z theory listing.

An example of a Z theory listing showing
all the different sorts of section
is given in section \ref{ExampleListing} below.

\subsection{Message Definitions}

The following new message definitions are used to achieve the above format:

=FAILURE
65001	The Z theory ?0
65002	THE Z THEORY ?0
65003	Global Variables
65004	Conjectures
=TEX
The implementation also borrows the following from \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD033}:
=FAILURE
33008	Fixity
33010	Axioms
33011	Definitions
=TEX

The strings ``$fun$'', ``$gen$'' and ``$rel$'' which appear in the
fixity part of the listing are part of the language and so are hard-wired
into the implementation.

\section{TEST POLICY}
The symbol table functions are to be tested according to the
general criteria laid down in the quality plan, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008}.
The automated module tests will only be able to test a limited amount
of the functionality. The important matter of checking the displayed and
printed format of the listings must be done by human
inspection in the integration testing.
