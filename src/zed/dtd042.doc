\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for some of the
derived rules of inference, conversions and theorems for
\ProductZ, described in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD015}. The rules and theorems cover Z language expressions, which includes some set theory, cartesian products and tuples.
This is called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD016}.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP042}.

\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the
initial set of rules, conversions and theorems for language expressions of \ProductZ{}. This covers :
\begin{itemize}
\item
set abstractions
\item
set displays
\item
tuples and cartesian products
\item
function application
\end{itemize}
See \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD041}
for the Z predicate calculus.

See \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD043}
for the Z schema calculus.

See \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD078}
for the start of the Z Library material.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Loading this document is dependent on \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP041}.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.
\section{LANGUAGE OVERLAP BETWEEN Z AND HOL}\label{ZCAVEAT}
Many of the functions below that generate results involving terms
are stated to ``remain within the Z language''
(indicated by their results being in $Ò...Æ$ or
left without any such brackets at all - this document assumes
Z as the default language, HOL terms are explicitly quoted).
This should be taken to mean that in so far as the original
input was within the Z language (i.e. the range of the Z mapping)
the results will also be
(except for certain renaming problems, etc).
This will be checked by some derivative of $is\_z$, unless
otherwise noted, informing the user
if Z has been left.
Later releases will use $¡\_to\_z\_conv$ to correct
what problems it can.

By default all relevant functions in this document should
be assumed to remain within the Z language and to check this fact, unless otherwise stated.
\section{EXPRESSIONS}
=DOC
signature €ZExpressions› = sig
=DESCRIBE
This provides the rules of inference, conversions and theorems for Z language set theory, tuples and cartesian products in the Z proof support system.
=ENDDOC
=THDOC
req_name €"z_language_ps"› (Value "z_language");
req_language "Z";
=DESCRIBE
The theory ``$z\_language\_ps$'' contains various ``defining theorems'' of Z language constants, derived from the definitions of
those constants, and consistency theorems for those
constants where necessary.
It is created in structure $ZPredicateCalculus$,
but primarily added to in
structure $ZExpressions$.

\subsection{Conversionals for Z Function Applications}
=DOC
val €Z_RAND_C› : CONV -> CONV;
val €Z_RANDS_C› : CONV -> CONV;
val €Z_LEFT_C› : CONV -> CONV;
val €Z_RIGHT_C› : CONV -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
$Z\_RAND\_C$ (resp. $Z\_RANDS\_C$, $Z\_LEFT\_C$, $Z\_RIGHT\_C$)
applies a conversional to the operand (resp. operands, left operand, right operand) of a Z function application.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Conversionals for ç}
=DOC
val €ç_C› : CONV -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
$ç\_C$ $cnv$ $tm$ takes a conversion $cnv$,
that applies to set terms,
will check to see if its term argument,
$tm$ is a membership statement.
If so, it will apply its conversion to the set.
If not it will fail.
It does not check that its result remaining in Z
(and indeed is applicable to HOL membership terms as well).
=SEEALSO
$Z\_ç\_ELIM\_C$
=FAILURE
42028	?0 is not of the form Òv ç sÆ or ¨v ç sÆ
=FAILUREC
And as conversion argument upon the set, with the error
being passed through by the conversional untouched.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val €Z_ç_ELIM_C› : CONV -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
$Z\_ç\_ELIM\_C$ $cnv$ $tm$ takes a conversion $cnv$
that can be applied to set memberships, and a set term $tm$.
The conversion is then modified to make it applicable to the term.
The resulting conversion will check to see if its term argument,
$tm$ is a set.
If so it will form the term:
=INLINEFT
Òxi ç ëtmÆÆ
=TEX
(where $xi$ is the first variable in $x1$, $x2$,... not
present in $tm$),
apply $cnv$ to the result,
gaining some equation:
=GFT
Ù xi ç ëtmÆ § f[xi]
=TEX
and then return the theorem
=GFT
Ù ëtmÆ = {xi : É | f[xi]}
=TEX
=FAILURE
42027	?0 is not a Z set
42026	unable to convert ?0 to the form: Òx ç {x:É|s}Æ
=FAILUREC
And as conversion argument upon the membership term, with the error
being passed through by the conversional untouched.
=ENDDOC

\subsection{Concerning Õ}
=DOC
val €z_Õ_rule› : TERM -> THM;
=DESCRIBE
This rule is given a Z $Õ$ expression (i.e. a Z definite description), and returns a theorem
that states what is required for this $Õ$ expression
to be equal to some value, $x$.
The requirement is
that if any value satisfies the schema text of the $Õ$ expression
then it must equal $x$,
and that $x$ satisfies the schema text of the $Õ$ expression.

Reduces a subgoal that states a Z application is equal to
something to sufficient conditions for this to be provable.

ignore the fact that in \ProductZ{} every predicate or expression is
equal to itself, and other vacuous variants of this.

The assumptions will be eliminated if trivial
(i.e. if the first assumption can be proven true by $z\_ç\_u\_conv$,
the second if the assumption is just $ÒtrueÆ$).

\subsection{Reflexivity, Symmetry, Transitivity of Equality}
The reflexivity of equality considered as a conversion is implemented by $refl\_conv$ in HOL, see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD007}.
This conversion may also be used for Z terms.

Similarly $eq\_sym\_conv$ and $eq\_trans\_rule$ also apply in Z reasoning.
\subsection{Extensionality}

If $w$ is of type $ty$ $SET$ where $ty$ is an n-tuple type, or binding type, then sufficient $x_i$ will be introduced,
instead of just $xn$, to allow $xn$ to be replaced by a construct
of bindings and tuples of the $x_i$, such that no $x_i$ has a binding or tuple type and appears exactly once in the construct.

the variables declared in $D'$ from the equation $T' = t$.
This attempt will always succeed if $T$ is the characteristic tuple of $D$.

No simplification is attempted by $z\_ç\_seta\_conv$

\section{PROOF CONTEXTS}
We provide the following proof contexts to reason about the above:

\begin{tabular}{l p{3in}}
$'z\_ç\_set\_lang$ & Simple algebraic reasoning about set theory of the Z language, especially $ç$. (e.g. $$) \\
$'z\_tuples\_lang$ & Reasoning about Z tuples and cartesian products within the Z language\\
$'z\_sets\_ext\_lang$ & Reasoning about Z set extensionality within the Z language\\
$'z\_bindings$ & Reasoning about Z binding displays\\
\end{tabular}

The above proof contexts
will allow $strip\_tac$ to remain within the Z language
on each of its steps, though with the caveat noted in \ref{ZCAVEAT}.

$step\_strip\_tac$ is able to
leave the Z language, which it does for
stripping
a Z existentially quantified antecedent to an implication.
However,
=INLINEFT
REPEAT step_strip_tac
=TEX
{} will remain within the Z language if its argument starts there.

Some stripping theorems (e.g., later, for $Ú$)
raise the dilemma of how and whether to
avoid leaving terms of the forms $Ò(x,y).1Æ$
(a special case is $Ò(x\ Ì\ y).1Æ$)
and $Ò(p.1,p.2)Æ$.
The first form is bad because of functionality problems;
the second is primarily bad because it is verbose,
but also because it provides a less general term for,
e.g., rewriting with.
We currently address this by including three theorems for
each problem operator, and relying on the discrimination
net effect of choosing ``the best match'' (see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD008})
to get results that avoid the forms $Ò(x,y).1Æ$ and $Ò(p.1,p.2)Æ$.
We include all three theorems in both rewriting and stripping,
without relying on $z\-\_selât\-\_conv$
during rewriting.
Thus for instance we include the theorems:
=GFT
Ù µ p S R∑ Òp ç S Ú R § p.1 ç S ± p ç RÆ
Ù µ p1 p2 S R∑ Ò(p1,p2) ç S Ú R § p1 ç S ± (p1,p2) ç RÆ
Ù µ p1 p2 S R∑ Ò(p1 Ì p2) ç S Ú R § p1 ç S ± (p1 Ì p2) ç RÆ
=TEX
The latter two theorems are automatically generated from the first.
This is only one possible solution, and not even necessarily the best.
Others include addressing the introduction of extensionality
variables, or ``fall back'' conversions if nothing else
applies to a term of the form $Òp\ ç\ qÆ$.
The operators affected (to date) are:
=INLINEFT
·, Å, Ú, í, and o

The question of whether to do the rewrites:
=GFT
(lab1 ¶ x.lab1, lab2 ¶ x.lab2) ---> x
(x.1, x.2) ---> x
=TEX
is controversial.
Thus they are not included in the basic proof contexts.
They interact with the treatment of equality on items with
tuple type and binding type, and other such things. One
can imagine two further component proof contexts, one
which does its best to expand all items of binding and tuple type into their respective displays (while avoiding looping),
the other which puts all such displays back together.
These may be better offered as conversions, based on mapping
the constuent conversions in an appropriate maner.

Further proof contexts could be more aggressive in
handling the equality of bindings.
