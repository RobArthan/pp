\section{Introduction}

\ {\ProductZ} is a dialect of Z which falls somewhere between that defined in the ZRM \cite{spivey89}\cite{spivey92} and that which will ultimately be defined as an  ISO standard.
The dialect is based on a proposal made to the Z standard review committee in March 1992, some elements of which have since been incorporated into the draft standard \cite{zip/prg/92/121}.

In due course we hope to bring {\ProductZ} closely in line with the ISO standard, and in particular we would like to provide an option which will fully check specifications against that standard.
For the purpose of conducting proofs however, we anticipate that extensions will continue to be available.

\subsection{The Structure of this Tutorial}

In this and following chapters the \ProductZ{} language and its proof support is described systematically but informally.

The description is organised around the abstract syntax for \ProductZ{}.
One section or subsection is devoted to each constructor in the abstract syntax.
Each of these subsections covers the abstract and concrete syntax, the semantics and proof support.

The emphasis is on illustration and example rather than on formal description.

This introductory section also addresses some topics orthogonal to the following sections.

\subsubsection{Paragraphs}

Usage of the term ``Paragraph'' follows the literature on Z.
Paragraphs form the top level constituents of Z specifications, and correspond to declarations, definitions, or constant specifications in HOL.
These effects in HOL are often not available as object language syntactic contructs, but are effected by the use of procedure calls in the metalanguage \ProductML{}.

The effect of processing a paragraph in Z therefore corresponds most closely to that of executing a metalanguage procedure in HOL.
Paragraphs do not have values, but are evaluated for their side effects, which are recorded in the \Product{} theory hierarchy.

Paragraphs in Z are formed using various other syntactic categories, including {\it predicates}, {\it expressions}, {\it schema-expressions}, and {\it declarations}.
In HOL the syntactic categories having similar roles are {\it types} and {\it terms}.

\subsubsection{Z Terms}

In mapping Z into HOL all of the syntactic categories for Z except paragraphs are mapped into HOL terms.
It is therefore convenient at times to talk of $Z Terms$, even though `term' is not used in the literature on Z, meaning a HOL term in the image of the Z to HOL mapping.

Furthermore, when dealing with Z in \Product{} at an abstract or computational level, it is convenient to regard the syntactic categories $predicate$, $expression$, and $schema expression$ as being combined into the single category $term$.
This is reflected by the provision of a \ProductML{} datatype called $Z\_TERM$ which reveals the abstract structure of the Z language in these terms.

Two functions are supplied with \Product{} which enable $TERM$s to be constructed from their components or broken up into their components via the datatype $Z\_TERM$:

=SML
mk_z_term : Z_TERM -> TERM;
dest_z_term : TERM -> Z_TERM;
=TEX

e.g., to contruct the Z predicate
=INLINEFT
ñtrue®
=TEX
:
=SML
val term_true = mk_z_term ZTrue;
=TEX
=GFT ProofPower output
val term_true = ñtrue® : TERM   
=TEX

To construct an implication:

=SML
val term_imp = mk_z_term (Z´ (term_true, term_true));
=TEX
=GFT ProofPower output
val term_imp = ñtrue ´ true® : TERM   
=TEX

To display the kind of Z construct represented by a HOL term, and the constituents of the construct:

=SML
dest_z_term term_imp;
=TEX
=GFT ProofPower output
val it = Z´ (ñtrue®, ñtrue®) : Z_TERM   
=TEX

=SML
dest_z_term term_true;
=TEX
=GFT ProofPower output
val it = ZTrue : Z_TERM   
=TEX

To bind the values of the constituents of a Z TERM to ML names use a pattern matching ML binding with $dest\_z\_term$:

=SML
val (Z´ (ante, concl)) = dest_z_term term_imp;
=TEX
=GFT ProofPower output
val ante = ñtrue® : TERM   val concl = ñtrue® : TERM   
=TEX

The datatype $Z\_TERM$ is described in detail below, and its structure is used as the basis for the explanation of the Z language support in \Product{}.

\subsubsection{Z Types}

Z is a typed language, and in \Product{}, the types of Z are mapped into types in HOL.
Types in Z are not provided with a concrete syntax, but a Z type may be described using a Z expression which denotes a set co-extensive with the type. 
The function:
=SML
z_type_of : TERM -> TERM;
=TEX
when given the HOL term representing a Z expression, returns a HOL term representing a Z expression which denotes the set of all elements of the type of the Z expression.

e.g.:
=SML
z_type_of ñ{x,y:î | x > y}®;
=TEX
=GFT ProofPower output
val it = ñú ª ú® : TERM   
=TEX

$z\_type\_of$ also works on Z schema expressions and predicates:

=SML
z_type_of ñ[x,y:î | x > y]®;
=TEX
=GFT ProofPower output
val it = ñğ [x, y : ú]® : TERM   
=TEX

=SML
z_type_of ñx > y®;
=TEX
=GFT ProofPower output
val it = ñBOOL® : TERM   
=TEX

\subsubsection{Quotation}

As illustrated above, for many of the syntactic categories in Z, and for terms in HOL, quotation facilities are provided in \ProductML{} which permit phrases to be written in the concrete syntax of Z or HOL.
Such quotations, whether in HOL or in Z, evaluate (after syntax checking and type inference) to yield HOL terms which form the internal representation of the construct.
When such terms are displayed a pretty printer is automatically invoked, which will use an appropriate concrete syntax for displaying the term.
The pretty printer is able to determine which concrete syntax is more appropriate for displaying a term, that of Z or that of HOL.

Both in quotations and in the formatting of terms for display, mixed languages are supported.
A term may have subterms in distinct languages.

The three languages of concern for this tutorial are \ProductML{}, \ProductHOL{}, and\\
 \ProductZ{}.
They are quoted using the quotation characters `
=INLINEFT
‘
=TEX
', `
=INLINEFT
¬
=TEX
' and `
=INLINEFT
ñ
=TEX
' respectively.
Quotations are terminated by the character `
=INLINEFT
®
=TEX
', irrespective of language, and may be nested.
Quotations in ML are sometimes known as ``anti-quotations''.
ML quotations are compiled and evaluated to yield a value of type TERM.
In addition HOL TYPEs may be quoted using `%
=INLINEFT
”
=TEX
', and may be entered as ML expressions of type TYPE using the character sequence:
=GFTSHOW
	¬èSML:ê
=TEX
which is printed as `%
=INLINEFT
 ¬èSML:ê
=TEX
'.
 
\subsubsection{Type Inference and Casts}

For the purposes of conducting proofs in Z using \Product{} it is often necessary to enter into the system fragments of Z in which free variables occur.
These are sometimes necessary, for example, when providing a witness for an existence proof.

When type inference takes place on a term entered with free variables the following rules apply:


\begin{itemize}

\item
Variables with names corresponding to the names of previously declared global variables are treated as occurrences of those global variables.
They are required to have types which are instances of the type of the global variable.
Z global variables are represented in HOL as constants.

\item
The subgoal package used for goal oriented or backward proof maintains a type inference context in which the types of all the free variables in the current subgoal are held (unless flag \\
$subgoal_package_ti_context$ is set false).
Free variables in terms entered by Z quotation will be assigned the type given in the type inference context if there is one, forcing them to match free variables in the current subgoal.

\item
If a free variable is not a global variable and does not appear in the type inference context, then its type will be inferred from its context in the quotation if possible.
Otherwise a new type variable will be introduced and used for the type of the variable.

\item
Type variables introduced during type inference cannot be constrained to range over tuple types or binding types in the present implementation, and therefore in places where a value of binding or tuple type is required (e.g., before `.') the type inferrer will report an error unless the type of the tuple or binding is apparent.

In the following `x' and `y' are assigned type variables without demur:

=SML
ñ(x,y).2®;
=TEX
=GFT ProofPower output
val it = ñ(x, y).2® : TERM   
=TEX

Whereas in this example, `t' must be assigned a tuple type, a type variable will not suffice:

\ignore{
=SML
set_flag("use_file_non_stop_mode", true);
=TEX
}%\ignore

=SML
ñt.2®;
=TEX

=GFT ProofPower output
Type error in ñt . 2®
In a term of the form ñT.number®, T must be a tuple
The following sub-term is not a tuple
   ñt:'a®
Exception- Fail * Type error [Z-Parser.62000] * raised
=TEX

\item

To overcome the above problem the user may supply, when necessary, additional information in the form of type casts.

For the purpose of applying type casts the infix operator `%
=INLINEFT
_º_
=TEX
' may be used to give guidance to the type inferrer on the type of a construct.

The constant `%For the purposes of type inference `%
=INLINEFT
_º_
=TEX
' is defined as follows:

[X]œœœœœœœœœœœœœœœœœœœ
Ü	Û_º_İ : (X ¸ ğ X) ­ X
÷üüüüüüüüüüü
Ü	µ x:X; y: ğ X· x º y = x
ˆüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüü

\ignore{
=SML
set_flag("use_file_non_stop_mode", false);
=TEX
}%\ignore

When used as an infix operator `%
=INLINEFT
º
=TEX
' forces its left hand operand to be an expression, whose type is that of the elements of the expression which is the right hand operand.
However, after type inference is complete, the term is constructed as if the constant and its right hand operand had not been present.
If it is required to generate a term which does include this constant then its fixity status may be locally suspended by writing `%
=INLINEFT
(_º_)
=TEX
' as a prefix operator.
In this case the constant will be treated normally.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Elided Actual Generic Parameters}

Generic global variables in Z are set-generic rather than polymorphic.
This means that when instantiated for use, they are instantiated with values which are sets rather than types.

When actual generic parameters are elided, the type of the parameter can usually be established by type inference, but this leaves open the choice of a particular set of that type for the actual parameter.

The choice made by the system depends upon whether the occurrence of the generic variable is in the paragraph defining the variable or in a later paragraph or term.
In the defining paragraph, generic parameters must be omitted, and are supplied by the system as identical with the formal parameters.

This may be seen by viewing the generic predicate subsequently extracted from such a paragraph:

=SML
z_get_specñ¥®;
=GFT ProofPower output
val it = ô [X]({Ş[X], ¥[X]} € ğ ğ X ­ ğ X
    ± (µ A : ğ ğ X
      · Ş[X] A = {x : X | ¶ S : A · x  S}
        ± ¥[X] A = {x : X | µ S : A · x  S})) : THM
=TEX
In this generic predicate all occurrences of `$¥$' are explicitly supplied with the formal parameter which were taken as implicit in the original declaration.

When actual generic parameters to global generic variables are omitted in contexts other than the defining paragraph the set supplied is the largest set of the inferred type, i.e. the set co-extensive with that type.

\subsubsection{U}

Because of the above behaviour of the system in inferring types and actual generic parameters, a special global variable, which we have called `U', turns out to be very useful.

`U' may be though of as if defined by the abbreviation definition:

=GFT Z
U[X] ¦ X
=TEX

If `U' is used in some specification or expression without supplying an actual generic parameter, the type inferrer will infer an appropriate type, and will then use for the actual parameter the set of all elements of that type.

This is used for two main purposes.
It is frequently used by the proof facilities where quantifiers are introduced automatically.
The main merit here is brevity and efficiency.
The second purpose is for expressing theorems which may be used for unconditional rewriting, since formulae universally quantified over `U' can readily be specialised for any type-correct rewrite, whereas quantification over other expressions gives rise to proof obligations which must be discharged before specialisation for rewriting can take place.

\subsection{Syntactic Categories}

There is only one form of quotation available for all syntactic categories in Z, encompassing predicates, expressions, and schema expressions.

Ambiguities therefore arise.
Two mechanisms are available to force interpretations other than the default interpretation taken by the parser.

The first is the use of casts of the form $value º set$, described above.
The left hand operand of a cast must be an expression or schema expression rather than a predicate, and use of a cast (even if the right hand operand is simply `U'), will therefore force interpretation of the left hand operand as an expression or schema expression (if this is possible).

The second feature is the operator $$.

$$ will accept as an operand only a predicate, and acts as an identity function on predicates.
It may therefore be used to force interpretation of an expression as a predicate.

While:
=SML
val schexp = ñ[x:î]®;
=TEX
is interpreted as a schema expression:
=SML
z_type_of schexp;
=GFT ProofPower output
val it = ñğ [x : ú]® : TERM   
=TEX

=SML
val predicate = ñ[x:î]®;
=TEX
is interpreted as a schema-as-predicate:
=SML
z_type_of predicate;
=GFT ProofPower output
val it = ñBOOL® : TERM   
=TEX

When occurring at the outer level in a quotation, or in other contexts where a predicate is expected, logical connectives are treated as propositional connectives rather than schema calculus operators.

\subsection{Z Terms}\label{ZTerms}

The definition of the \ProductML{} datatype $Z\_TERM$ is used as a guide to the syntactic structure of \ProductZ{} in the following description of support for \ProductZ{}.

This datatype is $not$ the type used for representing Z in HOL.
Ordinary HOL terms are used for this purpose.
However, HOL terms are an abstract datatype, and for some purposes it is more convenient to have a concrete datatype.
A $Z\_TERM$ is a hybrid representation in which the top level structure has been made more visible, through the structure of the datatype, but where the consituents are still HOL terms.

The definition of $Z\_TERM$ begins:

{\ftlmargin=0in\ftrmargin=0in

=GFT Z_TERM
datatype Z_TERM = 
=TEX

}

and then continues with a definition of each of the constructors which may be used to make a $Z\_TERM$ (these may be found at the beginning of subsequent sections of this document).

A constructor definition consists of the name of a constructor function, all of which (for this datatype) begin with ``Z''.
In most cases the name of the constructor is followed by a clause of the form:
``of type'' where ``type'' is an ML type.
This indicates that the constructor has a parameter and gives the type of the parameter.
Where there are in effect several parameters they must be supplied as a tuple.

For example, a logical conjunction of two predicates is represented as a $Z\_TERM$ by applying the constructor $Z±$ to a pair of arguments which are HOL terms representing the two conjuncts, e.g:

=SML
val conj = Z± (ñtrue®, ñtrue®);
=GFT ProofPower output
val conj = Z± (ñtrue®, ñtrue®) : Z_TERM   
=TEX

The structure of the datatype $Z\_TERM$ therefore presents a view of the abstract syntax of Z.
Under this view all the syntactic categories are collapsed into one, though the formation of terms is subject to well-typing conditions.
To assist the reader each constructor specification is preceded by an example of the concrete syntax of the construct, and parameter specifications are annotated with the syntactic category which would normally be expected.

Associated with these syntactic descriptions in the following are descriptions of the facilities for reasoning about the construct obtained, and more general descriptions of effective proof facilities and methods covering each area of the language.

\subsection{Definitions for Examples}

Wherever sensible the examples below are drawn simply from the language, using variables (sometimes propositional variables).
Sometimes global variables introduced in the Z ToolKit are used.

For the schema calculus examples however, free variables will not suffice, and the ToolKit offers no help.

The following schema definitions are therefore provided for use in the examples:

=SML
open_theory "usr011";
set_pc "z_library";
set_flag("z_type_check_only", false);
=TEX
¹Z
[NAME,DATE]
°
ÿFileüüüüüüü
Ü people : ğ NAME;
Ü age : NAME ß DATE
÷üüüüüüüü
Ü dom age = people
ˆüüüüüüüüüü
ÿFile2üüüüüüü
Ü people : ğ NAME;
Ü height : NAME ß ú
÷üüüüüüüü
Ü dom height = people
ˆüüüüüüüüüü
ÿFile3üüüüüüü
Ü people : ğ NAME
ˆüüüüüüüüüü
ÿFileOpüüüüüüü
Ü File;File'; i?:î
ˆüüüüüüüüüü

\section{Variables}

\subsection{Syntax}

{\ftlmargin=0in\ftrmargin=0in
=GFT Z_TERM
	(* local variable ñ x® *)
	
 |	ÛZLVarİ 	of string		(* variable name *)
 			* TYPE		(* HOL type of variable *)
 			* TERM list		(* generic parameters *)
 		
	(* global variable ñ U[DATE]® *)
	
 |	ÛZGVarİ 	of string		(* variable name *)
 			* TYPE		(* HOL type of variable *)
 			* TERM list		(* generic parameters *)
=TEX
}

In the literature variables in Z are either `local variables' or `global variables'.
This distinction corresponds fairly closely to the distinction in most logical systems between `variables' and `constants'.
In {\Product}, Z global variables are represented by HOL constants, and only local variables are represented by HOL variables.
 		
\subsection{Proof Support}

Local variables are mainly used either in constructs in which they are bound (e.g. in quantification), in which case the details of proof support may be found in the section for the relevant binding construct.
When free occurrences of local variables appear it is usually because of the skolemisation of existential quantifiers, or the elimination of universals.
In either case they then behave similarly to global variables about which only the facts in the assumptions of the current subgoal are known.

Global variables are most often dealt with in proof by rewriting the expressions containing them with the defining axiom for the variable, or by the use of theorems established about them by similar means.
Details of how this is achieved may be found in the chapter on Z paragraphs.

Integer and string literals are special cases of global variables whose definitions are built into the system.

\section{Literals}

\subsection{Syntax}

{\ftlmargin=0in\ftrmargin=0in
=GFT Z_TERM
 	(* positive integer literal ñ 34® *)
 	
 |	ÛZIntİ 		of string
 		
	(* string literal ñ "characters"® *)
	
 |	ÛZStringİ	of string
=TEX
}

Integer and string variables in {\ProductZ} are treated in a manner analogous to their treatment in HOL.
They are treated as if they were global variables (HOL constants) whose characterisation is built into the system.

\subsection{Proof Support}

Proof support for numeric literals is provided primarily through the proof context for the theory $z_numbers$, which is incorporated in the context $z_library$.
These include conversions for evaluating arithmetic expressions formed from literals.

=SML
PC_C1 "z_library" rewrite_conv [] ñ543*20®;
=GFT ProofPower output
val it = ô 543 * 20 = 10860 : THM   
=TEX

Proof support for strings requires a modest amount of mixed language working.
The conversion $z_string_conv$ converts a string literal into a sequence of character literals, however since the Z language contains at present no character literals, so these are displayed as HOL character literals.

=SML
z_string_conv ñ"string"®;
=TEX
=GFT ProofPower output
val it = ô "string" = §¬`s`®, ¬`t`®, ¬`r`®, ¬`i`®, ¬`n`®, ¬`g`®¢ : THM   
=TEX

Combined with the facilities for reasoning about sequences, and $char_eq_conv$ which decides equations over HOL character literals, this enables equations and inequalities concerning string literals to be solved.

\section{Declarations}

\subsection{Syntax}

{\ftlmargin=0in\ftrmargin=0in

=GFT Z_TERM
	(* declaration, e.g. ‘dec_of ñ[x,y:ú]®® *)
	
 |	ÛZDecİ		of TERM list		(* variables *)
  			* TERM		(* expression *)
  		
  			
 	(* schema reference, e.g. ‘dec_of ñ[File!]®® *)
 	
 |	ÛZSchemaDecİ	of TERM		(* schema expression *)
			* string		(* decoration *)
		
			
 	(* declaration list, e.g. ‘decl_of ñ[x,y:ú; File!]®® *)
 	
 |	ÛZDeclİ		of TERM list		(* declarations *)
=TEX

}

Declarations are constituents of most variable binding constructs, including the quantifiers which appear in the predicate calculus.
It is rarely necessary to enter a bare declaration using the Z parser, and declarations are not accepted by the parser as top level constituents of a Z quotation.
These remarks apply both to declaration lists, (which are using in the variable binding constructs) and their top level constituents, declarations and schemas as declarations.

If it is necessary to enter any of these constructs using the Z parser, a horizontal schema expression should be entered containing only the required declaration.
\ProductML{} functions may then be used to extract the required declaration list or declaration from the horizontal schema.
If a declaration list is required, then the function $decl\_of$ should be used, if a single declaration is required, then the horizontal schema expression entered should contain only the one declaration, and the ML function $dec\_of$ should be used to extract the declaration.

When declaration lists or declarations are displayed using the pretty printer the same format is used, involving an ML quotation.

=SML
val dec1 = dec_of ñ[x,y:ú]®;
=GFT ProofPower output
val dec1 = ñ‘dec_ofñ[x, y : ú]®®® : TERM   
=TEX
The pretty printer has here introduced some extra quotation symbols, which have no effect in this context.
=SML
val dec2 = dec_of ñ[File!]®;
=GFT ProofPower output
val dec2 = ñ‘dec_ofñ[File!]®®® : TERM   
=TEX

=SML
val decl1 = decl_of ñ[x,y:ú; File!]®;
=GFT ProofPower output
val decl1 = ñ‘decl_ofñ[x, y : ú; File!]®®® : TERM   
=TEX

\subsection{Proof Support}

For most uses of the system, proof support for transformation of declarations is built into the proof support for the construct in which the declaration appears, e.g. for the logical quantifiers.
Use of the features specific to declarations is therefore unlikely to be necessary unless detailed tactical programming is being undertaken.

In that event the basic facilities concern transformation between declarations and their implicit predicates.
This reflects the fact that the terms obtained by the above methods are semantically the same as the predicate implicit in the declaration list or declaration.
Other aspects of the semantics of a declaration (e.g. the characteristic tuple) are present only syntactically in these terms, and are not incorporated semantically until the declaration is used in the formation of some construct in which the characteristic tuple is semantically significant (e.g. a lambda expression).

The conversion $z\_dec\_pred\_conv$ may be used to transform a declaration into its implicit predicate:

=SML
val pred2 = z_dec_pred_conv dec1;
=GFT ProofPower output
val pred2 = ô ‘dec_ofñ[x, y : ú]®® ¤ {x, y} € ú : THM   
=TEX

=SML
val pred3 = z_dec_pred_conv dec2;
=GFT ProofPower output
val pred3 = ô ‘dec_ofñ[File!]®® ¤ (File!) : THM   
=TEX

The conversion $z\_decl\_pred\_conv$ may be used to cause a declaration list to be transformed into its implicit predicate:

=SML
val pred4 = z_decl_pred_conv decl1;
=GFT ProofPower output
val pred4 = ô ‘decl_ofñ[x, y : ú; File!]®® ¤ {x, y} € ú ± (File!) : THM   
=TEX

Conversions taking predicates into declarations are also available:

=SML
val dec3 = z_pred_dec_conv ñ{x, y} € ú®;
=GFT ProofPower output
val dec3 = ô {x, y} € ú ¤ ‘dec_ofñ[x, y : ú]®® : THM   
=TEX

=SML
val dec3 = z_pred_dec_conv ñ(File !)®;
=GFT ProofPower output
val dec3 = ô (File!) ¤ ‘dec_ofñ[(File!)]®® : THM   
=TEX

Note that here the use of $$ was necessary in the term quotation to force $File!$ to be interpreted as a predicate rather than as a schema expression.
