\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This is the detailed design for a type inferrer for HOL/Z,
responding to the high level design for the Z user
interface \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD018}.
The
implementation of this design is contained in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP062}.

\subsection{Introduction}
This document is organised as follows. The signature
declaration for the Z type inference module is introduced
at the beginning of the document, and constituents of the
signature are introduced at the appropriate points in the
discussion of type inference.
Next the data structure for representing Z terms
is described. This is used to communicate between the
Z parser, the Z type inferrer and the Z term generator
(when not using HOL/Z in {\bf Type Check Only Mode}).
An approach for error handling is then described in
section \ref{ErrorHandling}.

In section \ref{InferenceRules}, the inference rules
are introduced and each is desribed in a fixed format:
\begin{description}
\item[Signature]
The signature describes the type of the function
which applies the inference rule. It comprises part
of the Standard ML literal script produced when processing
the document with the command $docsml$ (see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR001}).
\item[Inference Rule(s)]
The type inference rules for each construct are expressed
in conventional notation.
\item[Description]
A description of the rules is provided, and any
issues relating to implementation are documented.
\item[Error Messages]
Example error messages which might be generated if application
of a particular rule fails are shown, as guidance to the
implementor.
\item[Error Codes]
The error codes, which correspond to parameterized
fragments of example error messages, are provided (They
are located deliberately in close proximity to their
respective examples to increase maintainability). This
subsection comprises another part of the
Standard ML literal script.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}

The type inferrer's job is to ensure that each of
these rules are obeyed in the process
of type checking a Z specification comprising
Z paragraphs interspersed with Z text.
A Correctly typed Z paragraph results
in either an indication of success (in {\bf Type Check
Only Mode}), or a helpful error message, returned
to the caller with the intention of the caller
reporting the error to the user.

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
The type inferrer makes use of the unification algorithm
described in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD014}.
\subsubsection{Interface}
The interface to the Z type inferrer is intended to be
used only by the Z parser, and is defined in the
signature $ZTypeInference$ introduced in section
\ref{Signature}. 
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
None Known.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None.

\section{THE SIGNATURE}\label{Signature}

The signature for Z type inference is dispersed through
this document.

Since the user is not intended to use
the functions provided in Z type inference directly, the
help information informs the user that this is the
case, and refers him to this document, which is intended
to fully explain the interface and purpose of each
function provided.

=DOC
signature ÛZTypeInferenceÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
The type inference rules are for use by the Z parser only.
See document reference DS/FMU/IED/DTD062 for further information.

\section{DESIGN ISSUES}

\subsection{Standard Versus Extended Z}

Facilities for checking a specification against the
standard Z language \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007} and
against extended Z are required.

The formal contents of a Z specification is
divided into two distinct categories for type
checking purposes.

Firstly, there is the Z which describes the specification
using Z paragraphs. The user is most likely to want to
check this against the standard Z language.

Secondly, there are fragments of Z which constitute
terms for use in proof scripts (e.g., goals, specializations), which are enclosed between the symbols `ñ' and `®'.
It is less likely that the user will want to check
this against the standard Z language, but will want
to check it against extended Z.

Two flags are introduced to implement these
envisaged requirements:

\begin{description}

\item[check\_paras\_with\_extended\_z]
for specifying that paragraphs should be checked with
extended Z (i.e., all Z constructs which are not
delimited by the symbols `ñ' and `®').

\item[check\_terms\_with\_extended\_z]
for specifying that Z terms should be checked with
extended Z (i.e., those Z constructs which are
delimited by the symbols `ñ' and `®').

\end{description}

=DOC
(* Ûcheck_paras_with_extended_zÝ  - boolean flag declared by new_flag, default: false *)
=DESCRIBE
If this flag is set, all Z paragraphs will be
type checked
against extended Z. Otherwise, they will be type
checked against standard Z. The default setting is false.
=ENDDOC

=DOC
(* Ûcheck_terms_with_extended_zÝ  - boolean flag declared by new_flag, default: true *)
=DESCRIBE
If this flag is set,  all terms enclosed
between `ñ' and `®' will be type checked against extended Z.
Otherwise, they will be type checked against standard Z.
The default setting is true.
=ENDDOC

\subsection{Error Message Handling}

When application of a typing rule fails, then
error information is returned. The details of this
information depend upon the particular inference rule.
A data type representing this information is
provided. This type is equated (in the implementation)
with an actual data structure which is private to the
implementation of the type inferrer.

=DOC
type ÛERROR_INFOÝ;

fun Ûhandle_ztierrorÝ : ERROR_INFO -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
Th data type $ERROR\_INFO$ is used to communicate error information
raised during type inference to the Z parser, so that the
latter may print diagnostics to the user.
The function $handle\_ztierror$ is intended to be called
by the Z parser to print type checking diagnostics.
The function raises the exception ``Fail''.
=FAILURE
62000	Type error
62001	Type error in ñ?0®
=ENDDOC

\subsubsection{Format of Error Messages}

It is desirable that type checking error messages
are consistent regarding style and format. Therefore all
error messages generated comprise the following components:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
the term being constructed when the error was detected
\item
a summary of the inference rule which was being applied
\item
the types of the manipulana which were being used in applying
the rule
\end{enumerate}

See section ({\bf Error Messages} of \ref{FirstRule}) for
an example of an error message following this format.

\section{DATA STRUCTURES FOR Z PARAGRAPHS AND TERMS}

The data structure for representing Z terms as a tree is
presented in this section. The form of the
data structure is determined largely by the grammar of
Z defined in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007}.

The following is an interim stub to permit type checking
of the rest of the signature (adapted from the prototype).
=SML
type ÛDECORÝ;
type ÛIDENTÝ;
type ÛZOPCLASSÝ;
type ÛZSCHTEXTÝ;
type ÛZEXPRÝ;
type ÛZDECÝ;
type ÛZTMÝ;
=TEX

\section{TYPE INFERENCE RULES}\label{InferenceRules}

The data structure which the functions provided
by the type inferrer return is
as follows:
=SML
datatype ÛINFERREDÝ = ÛInferredÝ of (ZEXPR * Unification.EXTYPE) OPT
		|	ÛTypeErrorÝ of ERROR_INFO;
=TEX

For a correctly typed term, the term is returned with its
extended type. For an incorrectly typed term, error
information is returned.

In sections \ref{FirstRule} to \ref{LastRule}, the
typing rules are defined. However, since
the type inferrer is only intended to be used by the parser,
and not by the user directly, documentation boxes are
not provided for each of the interfaces.

\subsection{Sequence Display}\label{FirstRule}

=TEX

=FRULE 1 Rule
÷
÷
E ô §¢ :: ð(ú ¸ ?new)
=TEX

=DESCRIBE
The rule for type inferring  types in a non-empty
list is as follows:

First, the types $ty1 \ldots tyk$, of the sub-terms
are inferred
(using the same environment $E$ for each one).
The types are then unified (using $list\_unify$),
and the HOL type corresponding to the Z type $ð(ú¸ ty1)$
is computed.

The result is the term constructed from the
type checked sub-terms and the type we have just computed.
The substitution arising from the unification is modified
as a side effect.

The case of an empty list display is described by the second rule. 
To type check an empty list 
a new type unknown is invented. The result
is that type,
with an empty list display. The
substitution is unchanged by this rule.

The elements of the sequence which have already had their
types inferred are required, together with the element
(and its type) which caused a unification error.

=DESCRIBE
There are two rules for this construct. The first one
corresponds to ordinary application and is attempted first.

If the unification for the first rule fails, then the
application may be the application of a predicate to
its argument (the second rule).

If the above cases fail, the application may be a generic constant applied to its generic actuals.
In this case, we wish to return just the function part (which should be a Ztvar with no generic actuals), with its generic actuals filled in from the type inferred argument.

The rules for conjunction, disjunction, bi-equivalence
and implication are the same.
$dy$ is one of `±', `²', `¤' or `´', and
$compatible$ is supposed to represent a test that
its two operands are compatible binding types.

To implement these rules we first type infer the operands.
If they both have manifest schema types we can perform
the compatibility test (unifying types of common components
as we go) and things are straightforward.
If they both have manifest boolean types all is well.
If one type is a manifest schema type and the other
is a manifest boolean type we enclose the schema operand
in a schema-as-term construct ($Ztschema$) if it is not
already enclosed in one (because in this case it must
really be a schema-as-predicate).
If the types do not fit any of these cases we flag an error.

=DESCRIBE
There are two cases, where the user may wish to impose a type constraint.
The first and most obvious is when the term must belong to some set (the term on the right of the º):
Moreover when the term returned when a typed term is encountered
should comprise the left hand operand.

The second case is where a schema text is being used as a predicate.
The type checker might be able to deduce this in some cases, but in others it is necessary to constrain the term to $bool$.
