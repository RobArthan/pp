\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This is the detailed design for a type inferrer for HOL/Z,
responding to the high level design for the Z user
interface \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD018}.
The
implementation of this design is contained in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP062}.

\subsection{Introduction}
This document is organised as follows. The signature
declaration for the Z type inference module is introduced
at the beginning of the document, and constituents of the
signature are introduced at the appropriate points in the
discussion of type inference.
Next the data structure for representing Z terms
is described. This is used to communicate between the
Z parser, the Z type inferrer and the Z term generator
(when not using HOL/Z in {\bf Type Check Only Mode}).
An approach for error handling is then described in
section \ref{ErrorHandling}.

In section \ref{InfRules}, the inference rules
are introduced and each is desribed in a fixed format:
\begin{description}
\item[Value Constructor]
The value constructor describes the part of the
data type for Z terms to which 
the inference rule applies. It comprises part
of the Standard ML literal script produced when processing
the document with the command $docsml$ (see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR001}).
\item[Inference Rule(s)]
The type inference rules for each construct are expressed
in conventional notation.
\item[Description]
A description of the rules is provided, and any
issues relating to implementation are documented.
\item[Error Messages]
Example error messages which might be generated if application
of a particular rule fails, are shown as guidance to the
implementor.
\item[Error Codes]
The error codes, which correspond to parameterized
fragments of example error messages, are provided (They
are located deliberately in close proximity to their
respective examples to increase maintainability). This
subsection comprises another part of the
Standard ML literal script.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}

The type inferrer's job is to ensure that each of
these rules are obeyed in the process
of type checking a Z specification comprising
Z paragraphs interspersed with Z text.
A Correctly typed Z paragraph results
in either an indication of success (in {\bf Type Check
Only Mode}), or a helpful error message, returned
to the caller with the intention of the caller
reporting the error to the user.

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
The type inferrer makes use of the unification algorithm
described in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD014}.
\subsubsection{Interface}
The interface to the Z type inferrer is intended to be
called only by the Z paragraph handling
routines, and is defined in the
signature $ZTypeInference$ introduced in section
\ref{Signature}. 
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
%\begin{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Deficiencies}

\section{THE SIGNATURE}\label{Signature}

The signature for Z type inference is dispersed through
this document.

Since the user is not intended to use
the functions provided in Z type inference directly, the
help information informs the user that this is the
case, and refers him to this document, which is intended
to fully explain the interface and purpose of the type
inferrer.

DOC
signature ZTypeInference = sig
=DESCRIBE
The type inference rules are for use by the Z parser only.
See document reference DS/FMU/IED/DTD062 for further information.
=TEX
\section{DESIGN ISSUES}

\subsection{Interfaces Provided}

A function is required which takes a Z paragraph, type
checks the paragraph and returns error information
if type checking error was detected, or a type-checked
Z paragraph together with a substitution function, mapping
type unknowns to actual extended types. The substitution
function is intended for use by the term generator.

There is an additional requirement for type checking
a limited variety of Z paragraphs connected by the ``\&''
symbol. This necessitates that the environment containing
the types of variables inferred be available to
the inferrer when checking the next paragraph.

\subsection{Error Handling}\label{ErrorHandling}

A key aspect of the success of the type inferrer is
the quality of error messages which are generated.
The type inferrer reports helpful messages which
are specific to the particular of inference rule which failed.
Error messages inserts are fragments of Z which should ideally
be easily understandable by the user.
It is the case that there are a variety of Z constructs
whose Z type written down, is very large. An approach to
this problem is to enable the type inferrer to look at
the type specified in the signatures of the component part
or parts of the term, and use this type in presenting
diagnostic fragments of Z.

When application of a typing rule fails, then
error information is returned. The details of this
information depend upon the particular inference rule.
A data type representing this information is
provided. This type is equated (in the implementation)
with an actual data structure which is private to the
implementation of the type inferrer.

DOC
type ERROR_INFO;

val print_zerror : ERROR_INFO -> 'a;
=DESCRIBE
The data type $ERROR\_INFO$ is used to communicate error information
raised during type inference to the Z parser interface, so that the
latter may print diagnostics to the user.
The function $print\_zerror$ is intended to be called
by the Z parser interface to print type checking diagnostics.
The function raises the exception ``Fail'' with the error
code 62000.
=FAILURE
62000	Type error
62001	Type error in ñ?0®
=TEX
\subsubsection{Format of Error Messages}

It is desirable that type checking error messages
are consistent regarding style and format. Therefore all
error messages generated comprise the following components:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
the term being constructed when the error was detected
\item
a summary of the inference rule which was being applied
\item
the types of the manipulana which were being used in applying
the rule
\end{enumerate}

See section ({\bf Error Messages} of \ref{FirstRule}) for
an example of an error message following this format.

\subsection{Standard Versus Extended Z}

Facilities for checking a specification against the
standard Z language \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007} and
against extended Z are required.

The formal contents of a Z specification is
divided into two distinct categories for type
checking purposes.

Firstly, there is the Z which describes the specification
using Z paragraphs. The user is most likely to want to
check this against the standard Z language.

Secondly, there are fragments of Z which constitute
terms for use in proof scripts (e.g., goals, specializations), which are enclosed between the symbols `ñ' and `®'.
It is less likely that the user will want to check
this against the standard Z language, but will want
to check it against extended Z.

\section{INFERENCE RULES FOR Z TERMS}\label{InfRules}

In sections \ref{FirstRule} to \ref{LastRule}, the
typing rules are defined. However, since
the type inferrer is only intended to be used by the parser,
interface and not by the user directly, documentation boxes are
not provided for each of the interfaces.

\subsection{Sequence Display}\label{FirstRule}

=TEX

=FRULE 1 Rule
÷
÷
E ô §¢ :: ğ(ú ¸ ?new)
=TEX

=DESCRIBE
The rule for type inferring  types in a non-empty
list is as follows:

First, the types $ty1 \ldots tyk$, of the sub-terms
are inferred
(using the same environment $E$ for each one).
The types are then unified,
and the HOL type corresponding to the Z type $ğ(ú¸ ty1)$
is computed.

The result is the term constructed from the
type checked sub-terms and the type we have just computed.
The substitution arising from the unification is modified
as a side effect.

The case of an empty list display is described by the second rule. 
To type check an empty list 
a new type unknown is invented. The result
is that type,
with an empty list display. The
substitution is unchanged by this rule.

=EXAMPLE

=TEX
\paragraph{Error Codes}~

Error message $62011$ is parameterized
by either a string which can be either ``sequence'' 
or ``set''. Message $62012$ has a second parameter;
for occasions when the number of elements to be displayed
is greater than one, the message requires pluralizationism.

The types of each element in a set display must be
unifyable to some type, $ty$. The type of a set display is then
$ğ ty$. If it is found that the elements are not unifyable, then
the error information produced lists each of the types
inferred, and the elements in the set corresponding to those
types. The elements are listed in lexicographic order.
This is the same as to be found in sequence and bag display.

There are two rules for this construct. The first one
corresponds to ordinary application and is attempted first.

If the unification for the first rule fails, then the
application may be the application of a predicate to
its argument (the second rule).

If the above cases fail, the application may be a generic constant applied to its generic actuals.
In this case, we wish to return just the function part (which should be a ZTmVar with no generic actuals), with its generic actuals filled in from the type inferred argument.

The rules for conjunction, disjunction, bi-equivalence
and implication are the same.
$dy$ is one of `±', `²', `¤' or `´', and
$compatible$ is supposed to represent a test that
its two operands are compatible binding types.

To implement these rules we first type infer the operands.
If they both have manifest schema types we can perform
the compatibility test (unifying types of common components
as we go) and things are straightforward.
If they both have manifest boolean types all is well.
If one type is a manifest schema type and the other
is a manifest boolean type we enclose the schema operand
in a schema-as-term construct ($ZTmschema$) if it is not
already enclosed in one (because in this case it must
really be a schema-as-predicate).
If the types do not fit any of these cases we flag an error.

We have two rules here corresponding to schema quantification
and to predicate quantification.
Here $Q$ is one of `$µ$', `$¶$' or `$¶‰1$'. $includes$ is intended
to be a function which checks that one manifest binding type includes
all the components of another unifying component
types as it goes.

The type rule for these monsters is discussed in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/ZED002}. Clearly both terms must
have manifest schema types.

The embedded function $f$ checks that the primed components of the first schema and the unprimed ones of the second correspond and are unifiable.  It returns a list of these components and the substitution resulting from the unifications.
