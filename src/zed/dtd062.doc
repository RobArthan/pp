\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This is the detailed design for a type inferrer for HOL/Z,
responding to the high level design for the Z user
interface \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD018}.
The implementation of this design is contained in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP062}.

\subsection{Introduction}

This document is organised as follows. The signature
declaration for the Z type inference module is introduced
at the end of the document.

In section \ref{InfRules}, the inference rules
are introduced and each is described in a fixed format:
\begin{description}
\item[Value Constructor]
The name and type of the value constructor describes the part of the
abstract syntax to which
the inference rule applies.
\item[Inference Rule(s)]
The type inference rules for each construct are expressed
in conventional notation.
\item[Description]
A description of the rules is provided, and any
issues relating to implementation are documented.
\item[Error Messages]
Example error messages which might be generated if application
of a particular rule fails, are shown as guidance to the
implementor.
\item[Error Codes]
The error codes, which correspond to parameterized
fragments of example error messages, are provided (They
are located deliberately in close proximity to their
respective examples to increase maintainability). This
subsection comprises another part of the
Standard ML literal script.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}

The type inferrer's job is to ensure that each of
these rules are obeyed in the process
of type checking a Z specification comprising
Z paragraphs interspersed with Z text.
A Correctly typed Z paragraph yields a paragraph decorated in the appropriate
places with types, and transformed according to the transformation rules described
in section \ref{transformations}.
An incorrectly typed Z paragraph yields error information in a datatype private
to the type inferrer. This can be displayed to the user in a formatted manner using
the interface $print\_z\_error$ provided by this module.

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
The signature for the Z type inferrer, $ZTypeInference$ requires
the signature $Unification$ and the modules which support the Z user
interface, $ZUserInterfaceSupport$
described in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD014} and \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD079} respectively.

\subsubsection{Interface}
The interface to the Z type inferrer is intended to be
called only by the Z paragraph handling
routines, and is defined in the
signature $ZTypeInference$ introduced in section \ref{Signature}.

\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
There is no type variable representation of schemas, so that when a schema type is
inferred for some variable, other occurrences of that variable
do not acquire that type correctly since the information is not recorded in
the substitution function. For example, in the predicate, $p ± p = [x:ú]$, the type
of the first occurrence of $p$ is $'a$ and not $(ú) Z'S[x]$.

\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
Unification for binding types could be supported. This would be a costly to achieve
which is why this version of the type inferrer does not do it.

\section{DESIGN ISSUES}

\subsection{Interfaces Provided}

See section \ref{Signature}

\subsection{Error Handling}\label{ErrorHandling}

A key aspect of the success of the type inferrer is
the quality of error messages which are generated.
The type inferrer reports helpful messages which
are specific to the particular of inference rule which failed.
Error messages inserts are fragments of Z which should ideally
be easily understandable by the user.
It is the case that there are a variety of Z constructs
whose Z type written down, is very large. An approach to
this problem is to enable the type inferrer to look at
the type specified in the signatures of the component part
or parts of the term, and use this type in presenting
diagnostic fragments of Z.

When application of a typing rule fails, then
error information is returned. The details of this
information depend upon the particular inference rule.
A data type representing this information is
provided. This type is equated (in the implementation)
with an actual data structure which is private to the
implementation of the type inferrer.

It is desirable that type checking error messages
are consistent regarding style and format. Therefore all
error messages generated comprise the following components:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
the term being constructed when the error was detected
\item
a summary of the inference rule which was being applied
\item
the types of the sub-terms which comprise the erroneous term
\end{enumerate}

See section (\ref{FirstRule} ``Error Messages'') for
an example of an error message following this format.

\subsection{Standard Versus Extended Z}

Facilities for checking a specification against the
standard Z language \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007} and
against extended Z are required.

The formal contents of a Z specification is
divided into two distinct categories for type
checking purposes.

Firstly, there is the Z which describes the specification
using Z paragraphs. The user is most likely to want to
check this against the standard Z language.

Secondly, there are fragments of Z which constitute
terms for use in proof scripts (e.g., goals, specializations), which are enclosed between the symbols `ñ' and `®'.
It is less likely that the user will want to check
this against the standard Z language, but will want
to check it against extended Z.

\subsection{Type Inference Context}
Like the HOL type inferrer described in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD016}, the Z
type inferrer is sensitive to the type inference context maintained
by the function $set\_ti\_context$ and its relatives. Any variable in the
context whose name is a possible HOL representation of a Z name is used
to determine (precisely) the type of any corresponding free variable in
the term being inferred.

\subsection{Communication with Term Generator}

In the HOL type inferrer of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD016}, type inference
and term generation is performed within one module. In the more complex
case of Z, term generation is performed in a separate module
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTDD063}. The two modules need to communicate the information
held in the substitution data structure built up by the unifications
performed during type inference. While the interface is functional, the
functions are actually accessing this imperative data structure; the calling
sequence is therefore important: if term generation is to take place after
a type inference call, then it must take place before any further type
inference is carried out (since that would overwrite the data structure).

\section{TRANSFORMATIONS APPLIED IN TYPE INFERENCE}\label{transformations}

\subsection{Variables}

All variables in terms and expressions which are received by the type inferrer
default to local, since the parser is unable to distinguish between local and
global variables.
During type inference, type inferrer builds up and environment which records
the names and types of variables and wgether they are locally bound variables,
global variables, or free variables. Those which are global, determined by their
presence in the current theory (or in its ancestry), are converted to global variables
in the abstract syntax tree ($ZTmGVar$). Free and locally bound variables are represented
in as local variables in the tree ($ZTmLVar$).


\subsection{True and False}

True and false are communicated to the type inferrer by the parser as
local variables which the type inferrer recognises and converts them to the
abstract syntax construct, $ZTmTruth true$ and $ZTmTruth false$ as appropriate.

\subsection{Membership and Equality}

The parser generates membership and equality constructs as functional application.
The type inferrer recognizes these as special cases of application and a term using
the membership or equality constructors ($ZTm$ or $ZTmEq$) as appropriate.

\subsection{Schemas as Predicates}

In places where schemas can appear as predicates, they default to being interpreted
(in the abstract syntax) as predicates. The constructor $ZTmSchemaPred$ is
inserted by the type inferrer to represent the coercion of a schema as a predicate.
This is done for example in implementation of the inference rule for predicate
negation and for logical infix operators for predicates.


\subsection{Relations}

A relation when applied to some argument or arguments is transformed into a statement
of membership of those arguments to the relation by the type inferrer.
For example, $R\  x‰1$ is transformed into $x‰1  (R\  \_)$; similarly
$x‰1\  R\  x‰2$ is transformed into $(x‰1, x‰2)\  \  (\_\  R\  \_)$.

\subsection{Sequences of Binary Relations}\label{seqbinrel}

An expression of the form $x‰1 R\  x‰2\  ±\  x‰2 R\  x‰3 ± ... ± sèn-1ê\  R\  x‰n$
where $R$ is a binary relation
can be written in the shorthand form $x‰1\   R\   x‰2\  R\  x‰3 ... R x‰n$
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF007}.

The type inferrer infers the types of each $x$ from left to right remembering
the substitution as it goes. It also transforms an abbreviated binary relation
to the conjuntion of all the individual relational expressions.
The types of generics must not be instantiated
differently within a binary relation sequence.
e.g., ${"A"} = š = {1,2,3}$ is invalid.

Given:

$x‰0~r‰1~x‰1~r‰2~x‰2~r‰3~...~rèk-1ê~xèk-1ê~r‰k~x‰k$.

where $r‰i$ are infix relation symbols (declared
using $rel \_~r‰i~\_$),
the transformation gives:

$(x‰0,x‰1)~~r‰1~±~(x‰1,x‰2)~~r‰2~±~...~±~(xèk-1ê,x‰k)~~r‰k$.

\subsection{Free Type Definition Arguments}

See section \ref{freetypedef}.

several kinds of typing error. They are grouped here for convenience.

\section{INFERRING TYPES IN Z DECLARATIONS}
=GFTSHOW Value Constructor
ZDDec of IDENT list * Z_TM * EXTYPE OPT
ZDSchemaDec of Z_TM * EXTYPE OPT
=TEX

The algorithm for type inferring Z declarations is as follows:

1. Type infer all the schemas as declarations using the input environment. This
gives the names and types of each component in all the schemas.

2. Grow the environment with all these components together with all the
declarative instances on the left hand side of normal declarations, noting
any incompatibilities that arise.

3. Type infer the right hand side of each of the normal declarations using
the extended environment.


The following inference rule applies to typed declarations.
=FRULE 1 Rule
÷
E « {x‰1 í Ô‰1, ..., x‰n í Ô‰n} ô Ó :: ğ Ó
÷
E ô x‰1, ..., x‰n : ğ Ó
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
The type on the right hand side of the declaration must be a set of something,
$ğ Ó$. The type of the $Ó$ is
type-inferred in an environment in which the declarative instances on the left hand side
are in scope. This ensures conformance with the Z mapping described in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/ZED002} and \cite{DS/FMU/IED/ZED003}.



The following rule applies to schemas as declarations.

\section{INFERRING TYPES IN Z TERMS}\label{InfRules}

In sections \ref{FirstRule} to \ref{LastRule}, the
typing rules are defined.



\subsection{Sequence Display}\label{FirstRule}


=GFTSHOW Value Constructor
ZTm§¢ of EXTYPE OPT * Z_TM list
=TEX

=FRULE 1 Rule
unifiable[Ó‰1, ..., Ó‰n]
÷
E ô x‰1::Ó‰1; ...; E ô x‰n::Ó‰n
÷
E ô §x‰1, ..., x‰n¢ :: ğ(ú ¸ Ó‰1)
=TEX

=FRULE 1 Rule
÷
÷
E ô §¢ :: ğ(ú ¸ Ó‰?)
=TEX

=DESCRIBE
The rule for type inferring  types in a non-empty
list is as follows:

First, the types $ty1 \ldots tyk$, of the sub-terms
are inferred
(using the same environment $E$ for each one).
The types are then unified,
and the HOL type corresponding to the Z type $ğ(ú¸ ty1)$
is computed.

The result is the term constructed from the
type checked sub-terms and the type we have just computed.
The substitution arising from the unification is modified
as a side effect.

The case of an empty list display is described by the second rule.
To type check an empty list
a new type unknown is invented. The result
is that type,
with an empty list display. The
substitution is unchanged by this rule.

\paragraph{Error Messages}~
=EXAMPLE
ñ§1,2,(3,4),5¢®;
Type error in ñ§1,2,(3,4),5¢®
Each element in a sequence must have the same type
Type ñú® inferred for the following elements:
   ñ1®
   ñ2®
   ñ5®
Type ñú¸ú® inferred for the following element:
   ñ(3,4)®
=TEX
\paragraph{Error Codes}~

=FAILURE
62011	Each element in a sequence must have the same type
=TEX



\subsection{Set Display}

=GFTSHOW Value Constructor
ZTmSetd of EXTYPE OPT * Z_TM list

÷
E ô {x‰1, ..., x‰n} :: ğ Ó‰1
=TEX

=FRULE 1 Rule
÷
÷
E ô {} :: ğ Ó‰?
=TEX

=DESCRIBE
The types of each element in a set display must be
unifyable to some type, $ty$. The type of a set display is then
$ğ ty$. If it is found that the elements are not unifiable, then
the error information produced lists each of the types
inferred, and the elements in the set corresponding to those
types. The elements are listed in lexicographic order.
This is the same as to be found in error reporting
for sequence display.
=TEX
\paragraph{Error Messages}~
=EXAMPLE
ñ{1,2,(3,4),5}®;
Type error in ñ{1,2,(3,4),5}®
Each element in a set must have the same type
Type ñú® inferred for the following elements:
   ñ1®
   ñ2®
   ñ5®

=TEX

=FRULE 1 Rule
÷
E « env(D | P) ô x :: Ó
÷
E ô {D | P · x} :: ğ Ó
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
We write $chartuple(D | P)$  for the characteristic tuple,
and $env(D | P)$ for the environment,
which arise from the type checked schema text $D | P$.

In a set abstration of the form ${D | P}$, the type of the
abstraction is the characteristic tuple of the schema text,
$D | P$.

In an abstration of the form ${D | P · x}$, the type of the
abstration is the type of $x$, inferred in an environment where the
declarations in $D$ are in scope.


\paragraph{Error Messages}~
=EXAMPLE
ñ{x:X | 0}®;
Type error in ñ{x : X | 0}®
In a term of the form  ñ{D | P}®, P must be a predicate
The following sub-term is not a predicate
   ñ0:ú®
=TEX
\paragraph{Error Codes}~
=FAILURE
62031	In a term of the form  ñ{D | P}®, P must be a predicate

=TEX
=DESCRIBE
The type of a tuple is
a product type where each type corresponds to the
type of each element in the tuple.

\paragraph{Error Messages}~
There are no error conditions associated with this construct.


\subsection{Binding Display}

The typing rule
requires the argument to be in the domain of the operator. The resulting
type is unknown and will be resolved by the context of the application.

=DESCRIBE
If the arguments of type constructors (i.e. $z‰1$ to $z‰n$) are
expressions which are tuples, then the expressions are transformed
by the type inferred into cross products to reflect the actual semantics
of a free type definition.
The type of such a constructor is then the type of an instance of the
cross product onto the type of the specified free type.

For example in a free type definition:
¹IZ
[TY]
°
¹IZ
rel	_ Cons _
°
¹IZ
FTY	::=	TY Cons TY
°
$TY Cons TY$ as a function application is the same as writing
$(\_\  Cons\  \_) (TY,TY)$. In a free type definition,
the type inferrer transforms this into $(\_\  Cons\  \_) (TY ¸ TY)$, whose
type is $ğ (TY ¸ TY)$. In the above example, the constant $(\_\  Cons\  \_)$ is given
the type $(TY ¸ TY) ­ FTY$.

				-> ZUserInterfaceSupport.Z_PARA -> Z_INFERRED;
	val Ûprint_z_errorİ : Z_ERROR_INFO -> 'a;
=DESCRIBE

The data type $ERROR\_INFO$ is used to communicate error information
raised during type inference to the Z paragraph processor so that the
latter may print diagnostics to the user using the
function $print\_z\_error$.

The function $type\_check\_z\_para$ performs type inference
on a paragraph. The result is constructed with $ZInferred$ if
the paragraph is well-typed; otherwise it is constructed with
$ZTypeError$.

The argument indicates to the type inferrer
whether to type infer according to standard Z or extended Z
and whether or not free variables are permitted.

The function $print\_z\_error$ is intended to be called
via the Z paragraph processor to print type checking diagnostics.
The function always raises the exception ``Fail'' with the error
code 62000.

	val Ûtype_of_z_extypeİ : Unification.EXTYPE -> TYPE;
	val Ûget_types_to_defineİ : unit -> Unification.EXTYPE list;
=DESCRIBE
These functions are for use in programming with the Z type inferrer.

The function $type\_of\_z\_extype$ converts
extended types (with which the
type inferrer decorates type-inferred paragraphs) to HOL types,
similar to $extype\_to\_type$ function in the $Unification$ module.
The difference is that here, the
free variable name map is not required as an argument.

The type inferrer has knowledge of type variable names which
are permitted (unique with respect to type variables occuring in
HOL quotations) and this knowledge is not public. $type\_of\_z\_extype$
uses this information to establish names of type variables
when type inferring paragraphs with free variables (permitted
in extended Z only).
This is why the interface is in the type inferrer module and not the
term generator module.

The type inferrer may insert binding or tuple types into its return value that may not have been declared.
The function $get\_types\_to\_define$ returns a list of extended types whose constructors need to be in scope to ensure that the output of the type inferrer can be converted into valid HOL terms.
The term generator must ensure that the constructors of all these types are declared.

=USES
The function $type\_of\_z\_extype$ is intended to be called
by the term generator subsequent to the types in a Z paragraph having
been inferred.

=DESCRIBE
This function is for use in programming with the Z type inferrer.
After a call to the type inferrer, a call to this function will return the list of free variables (including generic formals) that were encountered in the Z paragraph (or term).
This enables the caller to supply additional information in the case of an error.
(If the $allow\_frees$ component of the parameter to $type\_check\_z\_para$ is $false$, the list returned by this function will contain the free variable named in the exception raised by the type inferrer, if any.)

\section{TEST POLICY}
The facilities in this document are to be tested according to the general
guidelines laid down in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008}. Correct operation
of the type inference for the term quotation construct is extremely hard
to test in the absence of the term generator; tests for this construct
are therefore included in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/MDT063}.
