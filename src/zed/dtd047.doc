\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design of the constructor, discriminator and destructor functions corresponding to the primitive constructors of Z.
The formal specification of these is found in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/ZED002} and \cite{DS/FMU/IED/ZED003}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document gives a detailed design, in the form of signatures and informal descriptions,  of the functions mentioned above.
Some additional functions, e.g. those of sections \ref{U} and \ref{BINDING}, which are used in other parts of the Z system, are also be included here for convenience.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
The functions in this document are dependent on the Release 1 HOL System.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
\section{ERROR REPORTING}
For performance reasons, the arguments of the various constructors below are not checked for well-formedness or suitability and
it will therefore be possible, indeed easy, to construct terms which are not legal in our extended Z syntax.
Such terms will be identified by the pretty
printer~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD064} and will normally, though not
necessarily, be errors.
Of course, where the term construction fails due to some error detected in the underlying HOL or ML, it is intecepted and reported as helpfully as possible.
\section{INFIX DIRECTIVES}
A Standard ML $infix$ command must be given at the `top level'.
Thus we give the commands here for those functions declared in the following signatures.

=DESCRIBE
This datatype corresponds to a version of the abstract syntax of Z in which recursion has been removed and the distinction between declarations, predicates and terms ignored.
It is used by the generalised mapping functions $mk\_z\_TERM$, $is\_z\_term$ and $dest\_z\_term$ (q.v.).
=ENDDOC

\newpage

Whilst the names of the constructors of $Z\_TERM$ are intended to convey
their purpose, some are not immediately obvious.  The list below gives
brief explanations.  Each entry indicates the part of the Z~grammar that
it occurs within; namely: declarations, expressions, predicates or schemas. 

{\def\ITEM#1{\item[$#1$ ] }

\begin{description}

\ITEM{ZDec} Declare several names with a given Z~type, $basic-decl$ in
	the grammar, declarations.  May only be used (after applying

\ITEM{ZSchemaDec} Schema, with decoration, used as a declaration.  May
	only be used (after applying $mk\_z\_term$) as arguments of the
	$ZDecl$ constructor.  (Pronounce this constructor as ``Z~dec
	schema exp''.)

\ITEM{ZDecl} Declarations, $decl-part$ in the grammar, declarations.
	Applying $dest\_z\_term$ to the terms of this should yield only
	$ZDec$ and $ZSchemaDec$ values, correspondingly these two values
	may only be used (after applying $mk\_z\_term$) as arguments of
	this constructor.

	(The ``$TERM\;list$'' component is thought to have no purpose
	and should, perhaps, be deleted.)

val Ûbasic_dest_z_termÝ : TERM * TERM list -> BDZ;
=DESCRIBE
Function $basic\_dest\_z\_term$ does the work of destroying a term to
yield its Z~structure.  The arguments are in the result of applying
$strip\_app$ to a term.

A call of `$basic\_dest\_z\_term(strip\_app\;\;zt)$' will attempt to
destroy the Z~term $zt$, if successful (i.e., $zt$ is a valid Z~term)
then $BdzOk$ is returned with the appropriate $Z\_TERM$ value.  If $zt$
is not a valid Z~term then one of the other $BDZ$ constructors is
returned, these include an error code indicating what was wrong with
the term.  A~$BdzFail$ is returned when the term is similar to a
Z~term (i.e., it has a known constructor but the wrong number of
arguments).  In this case the $BdzFCompc$ and $BdzFArgc$ fields
tell how many component lists and arguments (respectively) are allowed
in a well formed Z~term.  A~$BdzNotZ$ is returned when the term is
not recognisable as a Z~term.  In cases where insufficient component
lists or arguments are given to a known constructor either $BdzFail$
or $BdzNotZ$ may be returned.

All of the error codes of function $dest\_z\_term$ may be returned by
this function.

Given an arbitrary term, $t$, $gvar\_subst$ creates a substitution
mapping those free variables of $t$ (in the HOL sense) which have the
same names as Z global variables (i.e. HOL constants) in the current scope
to the appropriate instances of those global variables (with generic
instantiation using $U$ as necessary). The resulting substitution may
then be used with $subst$, q.v., to ``bind'' the term into the
current scope.
