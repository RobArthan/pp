\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
derived rules of inference, conversions and tactics for
the ProofPower Z (see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD015}) predicate calculus.
This is called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD016}.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP041}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
initial set of rules, conversions and tactics for the predicate calculus of the ProofPower Z.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Loading this document is dependent on 
the Z Library \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD078} and Z Term generator
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD063}.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
The coverage in initial releases of ProofPower Z is aimed at the basic reasoning
tools, rather than a full coverage.
Thus we aim only to cover:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Rewriting
\item
Stripping conclusions and theorems (including assumptions)
\item
$µ$ elimination as inference rule
\item
Contradiction tactics
\item
$¶\_tac$
\end{itemize}
plus some of the auxiliary functions necessary for implementing these.
Thus, initial releases of the ProofPower Z tools will be
deficient in many areas in which reasoning is supported
for HOL.
\section{OVERLAP WITH HOL}
Some functions operating on Z have the same purpose
as an equivalent for HOL,
but perhaps different functionality.

Where this happens we will:
\begin{itemize}
\item
By preference use the HOL function, with, if necessary, parameterisation
changes provided by proof contexts (or, more rarely,
if at all, by other parameterisation).
In particular, if the functionality is the same, use the 
same function (e.g. $±\_tac$).
\item
Otherwise we will provide a separately named function for Z work.
The Z name will usually be formed by prefixing by
``$z\_$'', ``$Z\_$'' or ``Z'' (according to naming convention case and atom composition rules
followed by the object's name)
to indicate the object of
concern in the Z variant of the object.
\end{itemize}
Later releases might provide structures whose sole purpose is to
override HOL (i.e. primary language) objects by
their Z equivalents, and to undo this step.
There are both benefits and problems with this, and the final
approach is yet to be decided.
\section{LANGUAGE OVERLAP BETWEEN Z AND HOL}\label{ZCAVEAT}
Many of the functions below that generate results involving expressions and predicates
are stated to ``remain within the Z language''
(indicated by their results being in $ñ\ ...\ ®$ or
left without any such brackets at all - this document assumes
Z as the default language, HOL terms are explicitly quoted).
This should be taken to mean that in so far as the original
input was within the Z language (i.e. the range of the Z mapping)
the results will also be
(except for certain renaming problems, etc).
This will be checked by some derivative of $is\_z$, unless
otherwise noted, informing the user
if Z has been left.
Later releases will use $Á\_to\_z\_conv$ to correct
what problems it can.

Legitimately, we use HOL universal quantification
to represent generic formals.
However we will also allow arbitrary outer HOL universal quantified terms to be considered ``within the Z language'' 
where this is convenient, though this is avoided where possible.
\section{Z PREDICATE CALCULUS}
=DOC
signature ÛZPredicateCalculusÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
This provides a set of rules of inference, conversions and tactics sufficient for reasoning about the Z predicate calculus in ProofPower.
This structure declares the theory $z\_set\_theory$,
which is also used by structure $ZSetTheory$.
=ENDDOC
As theory $z\_set\_theory$ is also used by structure
$ZSetTheory$ we delay its theory design until 
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD042}.
\subsection{Subsidiary Functions}
\subsubsection{What is Z}
The following are extensions of work done in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD047},
and perhaps some of this material should be moved to that document.

Errors start with 4100.
=DOC
val Ûfull_dest_z_termÝ : TERM -> Z_TERM;
=DESCRIBE
This function acts as $dest\_z\_term$ on terms
(i.e. expressions and predicates)
in the Z language, but checks the full form of the
outermost Z syntactic construction in a
term to see whether it is in the Z language.
Thus, if the constituents of the construction
are valid Z, of appropriate syntactic classes,
then the overall term is also valid Z.
This is in contrast to $dest\_z\_term$ whose
intended purpose is to categorise Z terms,
and it only detects that terms are outside of the Z language if
the categorisation fails.

The function does not check that the constituents of the outermost Z syntactic construction
are as required.
For example, it does not check that the constituents
of a Z $decl$ are individually in the syntactic category $dec$.
=USES
To replace $dest\_z\_term$ when a term may be ``almost Z'',
but must not be categorised as Z.
=FAILURE
41002	Not within the Z language due to subterm ?0
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûis_zÝ : TERM -> bool;
val Ûis_all_z_typeÝ : TYPE -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
If the term (i.e. expression or predicate) or type given is in the range of the Z mapping
for a term or type respectively
then these functions will return true.
They will otherwise return false, unless the
only form of incorrectness is
that the constituents of a Z syntactic construction
are not as required.
For example, it does not check that the constituents
of a Z $decl$ are individually in the syntactic category $dec$.

The test traverses the provided object 
by using $full\_dest\_z\-\_term$ or $dest\_z\-\_type$ - the test is passed
if the entire term can be broken into non-type and non-term parts
(i.e. primitives such as strings or integers).
Otherwise it will fail with the given error message.

Note that a term is a subterm of itself for these purposes.
=FAILURE
41002	Not within the Z language due to subterm ?0
41003	Not within the Z language due to containing type ?0
=ENDDOC
The above test is not complete, later releases may
include a complete test for being Z.

We use the name $is\_all\_z\_type$ to distinguish
from the previously defined $is\_z\_type$.
=DOC
val Ûnot_z_subtermsÝ : TERM -> TERM list;
=DESCRIBE
This function will return a list (perhaps empty)
of all the subterms that prevent a term (i.e. expression or predicate) being within the
Z language (by the checks of $is\_z$, q.v.), starting with the rightmost subterm that is not Z.
The subterms given will be maximal in the sense that subterms of those given will not be included in the list.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
(* Ûcheck_is_zÝ : boolean flag *)
=DESCRIBE
This flag, if true (the default), will cause all Z inference rules and tactics that claim to remain in the Z language
to check any terms they change (i.e. assumptions and conclusions) for remaining within the Z 
language.
If any fail then the informational message 41004 is used
to output text to the user.
If the flag is false, no such checks are made.
The checks are computationally expensive,
and the results may be excessively verbose if terms are not 
all Z.
=FAILURE
41004	The following subterms in the result are not in the Z language: ?0
=ENDDOC
Actually, the flag be defaulted to true during initial work,
it perhaps later should be defaulted to false.
=DOC
val Ûcheck_is_z_thmÝ : string -> THM -> THM;
val Ûcheck_is_z_goalÝ : string -> GOAL -> GOAL;
val Ûcheck_is_z_termÝ : string -> TERM -> TERM;
val ÛCHECK_IS_Z_TÝ : string -> TACTIC -> TACTIC;
val Ûcheck_is_z_conv_resultÝ : string -> THM -> THM;
=DESCRIBE
For $check\_is\_z\_thm$,
if flag $check\_is\_z$ is true then the conclusion and
assumptions of the provided theorem are checked for being 
within the Z language (except for outermost HOL universal quantification), and informational message 41005 used if not.
The string argument is used as the name of the calling function in the error message.
If the flag is false then there is no effect.
In either case the theorem is passed through unchanged.

$check\_is\_z\_goal$ and $check\_is\_z\_term$ are analogous.
$CHECK\-\_IS\-\_Z\-\_T$ checks each of the subgoals
a tactic requests.

$check\-\_is\-\_z\-\_conv\-\_result$ checks
that the RHS of the resulting equational theorem,
and any assumptions are within the
Z language.
This allows the RHS side of the equation to have outer HOL 
universal quantification, and the LHS not to be Z (e.g. in an Z introduction conversion) without complaint.
=FAILURE
41005	In the result of ?0 the following subterms are not in the Z language: ?1
=ENDDOC

\subsubsection{Adjustment after Á-conversion}
Errors start with 4110.

If a substitution via $var\_subst$ is made upon a term in Z (that may be
part of a theorem or subgoal) by the 
many important functions that call $var\_subst$
(e.g. rewriting and $µ$ elimination),
and if this substitution causes bound variable renaming, the
resulting term may no longer be in the Z language.
This may be because either the types of 
$decl$-style bindings
(see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/ZED002}, the section upon ``Variable Binding Constructs'') may no longer match the variable names bound,
or because the variables in the binding have ceased being in a canonical order.
Either of these two problems can be ``fixed'' by post-processing.
The problems may be adjusted back to Z by using
Z renaming constructs, reordering of quantifiers or by $Á$-conversion,
returning the term to being within
the Z language.

Other ProofPower functions, such as $inst$ may also cause
undesirable renaming.

The following two functions fulfil this need:
=DOC
val ÛÁ_to_zÝ : TERM -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
This function will adjust all sub-terms that fail to be 
Z because either:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The subterm is involves a $decl$-style binding, and the type of the binding
does not match the names of the variables bound.
This is adjusted using the Z renaming construct.
\item
The subterm is a $decl$-style binding whose bound variables are not
in the canonical ordering that would result from the Z mapping.
This is adjusted by reorganising the order of abstractions and arguments.
\end{itemize}
If a HOL $Á$-conversion will suffice then that will be
used instead.

Subterms that are not covered by these two cases will be traversed and their own subterms checked, regardless of their language.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.
=SEEALSO
$Á\_to\_z\_conv$
=FAILURE
41100	No adjustment took place
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val ÛÁ_to_z_convÝ : CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This function will return the equality theorem between a term
and one that adjusts all sub-terms that fail to be 
Z because either:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The subterm is a $decl$-style binding, and the type of the binding
does not match the names of the variables bound.
This is adjusted using the Z renaming construct.
\item
The subterm is a $decl$-style binding whose bound variables are not
in the canonical ordering that would result from the Z mapping.
This is adjusted by reorganising the order of abstractions and arguments.
\end{itemize}
If a HOL $Á$-conversion will suffice then that will be
used instead.

Subterms that are not covered by these two cases will be traversed and their own subterms checked, regardless of their language.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

\subsubsection{Concerning Generic Formals}
These are represented by HOL universals and may thus
be manipulated by $µ\_elim$, etc.

\subsection{Concerning The Universe, U} \label{U}
Errors start with 4106.

In \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD078} the following definition is given.
 
¹ U[X]œ
Ü U : ð X
÷
Ü U = X
ˆ

This definition is supplied purely for convenience. 
If a generic global variable appears without any supplied generic actuals then the variable is taken to be generic 
in $ñU®$.
This leads to terms which are polymorphic, rather than truly set generic. The following material about $U$ is provided to facilitate discharging the proof obligation of implicit predicates in Z declarations.
=DOC
val Ûu_convÝ : CONV;

\subsection{Concerning Z Universal Quantification}
Errors start with  4102 or 4107
=DOC
val Ûz_µ_elimÝ : TERM -> THM -> THM;
=DESCRIBE

=TEX
where $D$ is a declaration that binds the $x‰i$,
that is converted to a predicate form, by 
=INLINEFT
DECL_C dec_pred_conv
=TEX
. 
The theorem may be type instantiated or require bound variable renaming to allow the 
specialisation to be valid, thus the priming in the result.

If both the supplied binding and the declaration are
recognisably ``empty'' then the universal quantification will be eliminated.

If instead the theorem's conclusion has a single universally quantified variable and the theorem can be type instantiated to match the supplied argument, then that supplied argument will be used directly.

\subsection{Eliminating Z Quantifiers}
=DOC
val Ûz_quantifiers_elim_tacÝ : TACTIC;
=DESCRIBE
This tactic eliminates all Z $µ$, $¶$ and $¶‰1$ quantifiers
in both conclusion and assumptions,
in favour of HOL $µ$ and $¶$,
using $z\-\_µ\-\_elim\-\_conv$, $z\-\_¶\-\_elim\-\_conv$,
 $z\-\_¶‰1\-\_conv1$.
All declarations introduced will be converted to Z predicates,
and the following simplifications also done throughout: 
=GFT
ñ{x,y,...} € s®  ---> ¬x  s ± y  s ± ...® 
	(* only when the set display contains just variables *)
ñx ± true®  ---> ¬x®
ñtrue ± x®  ---> ¬x®
ñx ´ true®  ---> ¬true®
=TEX
All assumptions will be stripped back into the assumption
list, regardless of whether they were modified,
using the current proof context.

This is done to prepare for some further processing, such 
as resolution.
The result is unlikely to be in the Z language,
and is only intended for implementing automated proof
procedures.
It has no effect 
(rather than failing) if there are no conversions to be done.

\subsection{Conditional Rewriting}
This is a yet to be implemented part of the HOL system,

\section{Z STRIPPING AND PROOF CONTEXTS}
=DOC
val Ûz_basic_prove_tacÝ : THM list -> TACTIC;
=DESCRIBE
This is the tactic used for the automated proof tactic (the $pr\_tac$ field) of most
supplied Z proof contexts,
and is a reasonable, general-purpose, automatic proof tactic
for Z.

In summary it will:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Extract the assumption list, rewrite each extracted assumption with the current
default rewrite rules and given theorems, and strip the results back into the assumption list.
\item
Attempt to rewrite the resulting goal's conclusions with the current
default rewrite rules and given theorems.
\item
Repeatedly apply $strip\_tac$ to the conclusions of the resulting goals.
\item
In all resulting goals replace all Z quantifiers by their HOL equivalents in both assumptions and goal. 
This has no effect on any resulting goal if it is unsolved.
\item
Apply $all\_asm\_fc\_tac$ once to each resulting goal.
\item
Attempt to prove each of the resulting goals with resolution for up to 3 resolution steps, with goal's negated conclusion
as a resolvant that must be used, and the assumptions as possible
other resolvants.
This has no effect on any resulting goal if it is unsolved.
\item
Attempt to prove each of the resulting goals with resolution for up to 3 resolution steps amongst
just the assumptions.
This has no effect on any resulting goal if it is unsolved.
\end{enumerate}

Note that either stripping step may result in more than one subgoal, and thus the plural ``resulting goals''.

Under the current interface to
resolution this is
=GFT
fun z_basic_prove_tac thms =
DROP_ASMS_T (MAP_EVERY (strip_asm_tac o rewrite_rule thms) o rev) THEN
(TRY_T (rewrite_tac thms)) THEN
REPEAT strip_tac THEN_TRY
(z_quantifiers_elim_tac
 THEN basic_res_tac2 3 [ô µ x · x = x] 
 ORELSE_T basic_res_tac3 3 [ô µ x · x = x]);
=TEX
=ENDDOC
The ``3 resolution steps'' is a fixed number of steps, chosen as a compromise between finding all possible resolution proofs
and the costs of such attempts.
For finer tuning, use the resolution package more directly.
=DOC
val Ûz_basic_prove_convÝ : THM list -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This is the conversion used for the automatic proof conversion ($pr\_tac$ field) of most
supplied proof contexts,
and is a reasonable, general-purpose, automatic proof conversion.
It will either prove the theorem with the given conclusion, or fail.

In summary it will:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Set the term as the goal of the subgoal package.
\item
Attempt to rewrite the term with the current
default rewrite rules and given theorems.
\item
Repeatedly apply $strip\_tac$ to the goal.
\item
In all resulting goals replace all Z quantifiers by their HOL equivalents in both assumptions and goal.
\item
Apply $all\_asm\_fc\_tac$ once to each resulting goal.
\item
Attempt to prove the resulting goals with resolution for up to 3 resolution steps, with goal's negated conclusion
as a resolvant that must be used, and the assumptions as possible
other resolvants.
\item
Attempt to prove the resulting goals with resolution for up to 3 resolution steps amongst
just the assumptions.
\item
If the proof is successful, return 
=INLINEFT
ô term ¤ T
=TEX
{} and otherwise fail.
\end{enumerate}

Note that in the stripping step may result in more than one subgoal, and thus the plural ``resulting goals''.

Under the current interface to
resolution this equivalent to:
=GFT
fun z_basic_prove_conv thms tm =
¤_t_intro (
tac_proof(([],tm),
	TRY_T (rewrite_tac thms)  THEN 
	REPEAT strip_tac THEN
	(z_quantifiers_elim_tac THEN
	basic_res_tac2 3 [ô µ x · x = x] 
	ORELSE_T basic_res_tac3 3 [ô µ x · x = x]))
);
=TEX
In the implementation however, partial evaluation with just the theorems is allowed.

\paragraph{Usage Notes}
It requires theory $z\-\_predicate\-\_calculus$.
It is not intended to be mixed with HOL proof contexts.
Use with proof context ``$'$z$\_$decl'' to handle declarations
properly.
=ENDDOC

This proof context
will allow $strip\_tac$ to remain within the Z language
on each of its steps, though with the caveat noted in \ref{ZCAVEAT}.

$step\_strip\_tac$ is able to
leave the Z language, which it does for 
stripping
a Z existentially quantified antecedent to an implication.
However, 
=INLINEFT
REPEAT step_strip_tac
=TEX
{} will remain within the Z language if its argument starts there.

Note that rewriting does not expand Z $¶‰1$-terms.

The proof context does not concern itself with schema references,
though these are Z language predicates.

Treating the universal set, $U$, in this proof context is 
apparently not in keeping with the context's theme,
but it is useful to handle trivial quantifier
declarations. Such material could be moved to proof context ``$'$z$\_$decl''.
