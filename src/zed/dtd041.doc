\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
derived rules of inference, conversions and tactics for
the ProofPower Z (see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD015}) predicate calculus.
This is called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD016}.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP041}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
initial set of rules, conversions and tactics for the predicate calculus of the ProofPower Z.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Loading this document is dependent on 
the Z Library \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD078} and Z Term generator
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD063}.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
The coverage in initial releases of ProofPower Z is aimed at the basic reasoning
tools, rather than a full coverage.
Thus we aim only to cover:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Rewriting
\item
Stripping goals and theorems
\item
$µ$ elimination as inference rule
\item
Contradiction tactic
\item
$¶\_tac$
\end{itemize}
plus some of the auxiliary functions necessary for implementing these.
Thus, initial releases of the ProofPower Z tools will be
deficient in many areas in which reasoning is supported
for HOL.
\section{OVERLAP WITH HOL}
Some functions operating on Z have the same purpose
as an equivalent for HOL,
but perhaps different functionality.

Where this happens we will
\begin{itemize}
\item
By preference use the HOL function, with, if necessary, parameterisation
changes provided by proof contexts (or, more rarely,
if at all, by other parameterisation).
In particular, if the functionality is the same, use the 
same function (e.g. $±\_tac$).
\item
Otherwise we will provide a separately named function for Z work.
The Z name will usually be formed by prefixing by
``$z\_$'', ``$Z\_$'' or ``Z'' (according to naming convention case and atom composition rules
followed by the object's name)
to indicate the object of
concern in the Z variant of the object.
\end{itemize}
Later releases might provide structures whose sole purpose is to
override HOL (i.e. primary language) objects by
their Z equivalents, and to undo this step.
There are both benefits and problems with this, and the final
approach is yet to be decided.
\section{LANGUAGE OVERLAP BETWEEN Z AND HOL}\label{ZCAVEAT}
Many of the functions below that generate results involving terms
are stated to ``remain within the Z language''
(indicated by their results being in $ñ\ ...\ ®$ or
left without any such brackets at all - this document assumes
Z as the default language, HOL terms are explicitly quoted).
This should be taken to mean that in so far as the original
input was within the Z language (i.e. the range of the Z mapping)
the results will also be
(except for certain renaming problems, etc).
This will be checked by some derivative of $is\_z$, unless
otherwise noted, informing the user
if Z has been left.
Later releases will use $Á\_to\_z\_conv$ to correct
what problems it can.

Legitimately, we use HOL universal quantification
to represent generic formals.
However we will also allow arbitrary outer universally quantified terms to be considered ``within the Z language'' 
where this is convenient - the most notable example of this
is in $strip\_tac$ when a Z universal quantification is broken into a sequence of HOL universal quantifications.
\section{Z PREDICATE CALCULUS}
=DOC
signature ÛZPredicateCalculusÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
This provides a set of rules of inference, conversions and tactics sufficient for reasoning about the Z predicate calculus in ProofPower.
This structure declares the theory $z\_set\_theory$,
which is also used by structure $ZSetTheory$.
=ENDDOC
As theory $z\_set\_theory$ is also used by structure
$ZSetTheory$ we delay its theory design until 
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD042}.
\subsection{Subsidiary Functions}
\subsubsection{What is Z}
The following are extensions of work done in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD047},
and perhaps some of this material should be moved to that document.

Errors start with 4100.
=DOC
val Ûfull_dest_z_termÝ : TERM -> Z_TERM;
=DESCRIBE
This function acts as $dest\_z\_term$ on terms
in the Z language, but checks the full form of the
outermost Z syntactic construction in a
term to see whether it is in the Z language.
Thus, if the consituents of the construction
are valid Z, of appropriate syntactic classes,
then the overall term is also valid Z.
This is in contrast to $dest\_z\_term$ whose
intended purpose is to categorise Z terms,
and it only detects that terms are outside of the Z language if
the categorisation fails.

The function does not check that the constituents of the outermost Z syntactic construction
are as required.
For example, it does not check that the constituents
of a Z $decl$ are individually in the syntactic category $dec$.
=USES
To replace $dest\_z\_term$ when a term may be ``almost Z'',
but must not be categorised as Z.
=FAILURE
41002	Not within the Z language due to subterm ?0
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûis_zÝ : TERM -> bool;
val Ûis_all_z_typeÝ : TYPE -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
If the term or type given is in the range of the Z mapping
for a term or type respectively
then these functions will return true.
They will otherwise return false, unless the
only form of incorrectness is
that the constituents of a Z syntactic construction
are not as required.
For example, it does not check that the constituents
of a Z $decl$ are individually in the syntactic category $dec$.

The test is to traverse the provided object 
by using $full\_dest\_z\-\_term$ or $dest\_z\-\_type$ - the test is passed
if the entire term can be broken into non-type and non-term parts.
Otherwise it will fail with the given error message.

Note that a term is a subterm of itself for these purposes.
=FAILURE
41002	Not within the Z language due to subterm ?0
41003	Not within the Z language due to containing type ?0
=ENDDOC
We use the name $is\_all\_z\_type$ to distinguish
from the previously defined $is\_z\_type$.
=DOC
val Ûnot_z_subtermsÝ : TERM -> TERM list;
=DESCRIBE
This function will return a list (perhaps empty)
of all the subterms that prevent a term being within the
Z language (by the checks of $is\_z$, q.v.), starting with the rightmost subterm that is not Z.
The subterms given will be maximal in the sense that subterms of those given will not be included in the list.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
(* Ûcheck_is_zÝ : boolean flag *)
=DESCRIBE
This flag, if true (the default), will cause all Z inference rules and tactics that claim to remain in the Z langauge
to check any terms they change (i.e. assumptions and conclusions) for remaining within the Z 
language.
If any fail then the informational message 41004 is used
to output text to the user.
If the flag is false, no such checks are made.
The checks are computationally expensive,
and the results may be excessively verbose if terms are not 
all Z.
=FAILURE
41004	The following subterms in the result are not in the Z language: ?0
=ENDDOC
Actually, only initial work the flag will be defaulted to true,
it perhaps later should be false.
=DOC
val Ûcheck_is_z_thmÝ : string -> THM -> THM;
val Ûcheck_is_z_goalÝ : string -> GOAL -> GOAL;
val Ûcheck_is_z_termÝ : string -> TERM -> TERM;
val ÛCHECK_IS_Z_TÝ : string -> TACTIC -> TACTIC;
val Ûcheck_is_z_conv_resultÝ : string -> THM -> THM;
=DESCRIBE
For $check\_is\_z\_thm$,
if flag $check\_is\_z$ is true then the conclusion and
assumptions of the provided theorem are checked for being 
within the Z language (except for outermost HOL universal quantification), and informational message 41005 used if not.
The string argument is used as the name of the calling function in the error message.
If the flag is false then there is no effect.
In either case the theorem is passed through unchanged.

$check\_is\_z\_goal$ and $check\_is\_z\_term$ are analogous.
$CHECK\-\_IS\-\_Z\-\_T$ checks each of the subgoals
a tactic requests.

$check\-\_is\-\_z\-\_conv\-\_result$ checks
that the RHS of the resulting equational theorem,
and any assumptions are within the
Z language.
This allows the RHS side of the equation to have outer HOL 
universal quantification, and the LHS not to be Z (e.g. in an Z introduction conversion) without complaint.
=FAILURE
41005	In the result of ?0 the following subterms are not in the Z language: ?1
=ENDDOC

\subsubsection{Adjustment after Á-conversion}
Errors start with 4110.

If a substitution via $var\_subst$ is made upon a term in Z (that may be
part of a theorem or subgoal) by the 
many important functions that call $var\_subst$
(e.g. rewriting and $µ$ elimination),
and if this substitution causes bound variable renaming, the
resulting term may no longer be in the Z language.
This may be because either the types of 
$decl$-style bindings
(see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/ZED002}, the section upon ``Variable Binding Constructs'') may no longer match the variable names bound,
or because the variables in the binding have ceased being in a canonical order.
Either of these two problems can be ``fixed'' by post-processing.
The problems may be adjusted back to Z by using
Z renaming constructs, returning the term to being within
the Z language.

Other ProofPower functions, such as $inst$ may also cause
undesirable renaming.

The following two functions fulfil this need:
=DOC
val ÛÁ_to_zÝ : TERM -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
This function will adjust all sub-terms that fail to be 
Z because either:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The subterm is involves a $decl$-style binding, and the type of the binding
does not match the names of the variables bound.
This is adjusted using the Z renaming construct.
\item
The subterm is a $decl$-style binding whose bound variables are not
in the canonical ordering that would result from the Z mapping.
This is adjusted by reorganising the order of abstractions and arguments.
\end{itemize}
If a HOL $Á$-conversion will suffice then that will be
used instead.

Subterms that are not covered by these two cases will be traversed and their own subterms checked, regardless of their language.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.
=SEEALSO
$Á\_to\_z\_conv$
=FAILURE
41100	No adjustment took place
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val ÛÁ_to_z_convÝ : CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This function will return the equality theorem between a term
and one that adjusts all sub-terms that fail to be 
Z because either:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The subterm is a $decl$-style binding, and the type of the binding
does not match the names of the variables bound.
This is adjusted using the Z renaming construct.
\item
The subterm is a $decl$-style binding whose bound variables are not
in the canonical ordering that would result from the Z mapping.
This is adjusted by reorganising the order of abstractions and arguments.
\end{itemize}
If a HOL $Á$-conversion will suffice then that will be
used instead.

Subterms that are not covered by these two cases will be traversed and their own subterms checked, regardless of their language.

\subsubsection{Concerning The Universe, U} \label{U}

This definition is supplied purely for convenience. 
If a generic global variable appears without any supplied generic actuals then the variable is taken to be generic 
in $ñU®$.
This leads to terms which are polymorphic, rather than truly set generic. The following material about $U$ is provided to facilitate discharging the proof obligation of implicit predicates in Z declarations.

\subsubsection{Concerning Generic Formals}
These are represented by HOL universals and may thus
be manipulated by $µ\_elim$, etc.
\subsection{Concerning Z Universal Quantification}
Errors start with  4102 or 4107
=DOC

that is converted to a predicate form, by 
=INLINEFT

. 
The theorem may be type instantiated to allow the 
specialisation to be valid, thus the primed $Pi$.

If both the supplied binding and the declaration are
recognisably ``empty'' then the universal quantification will be eliminated.

Note that we never break apart a Z $¶$ into HOL quantifiers.

Rewriting canonicalisation:
=GFT
µ_rewrite_canon, z_³_rewrite_canon, ±_rewrite_canon, 
f_rewrite_canon, z_µ_rewrite_canon, z_defn_canon
=TEX
Notice in particular the use of the HOL $µ\_rewrite\_canon$.

Automatic proof procedures are respectively $basic\-\_prove\-\_tac$,
$basic\-\_prove\-\_conv$,
and
the list
=GFT
z_¶_elim_conv,
ALL_SIMPLE_¶_C ``simplifications as z_defn_canon'',
basic_prove_¶_conv
=TEX
Pattern matching in $¶$ proofs understands Z 2-tuples.
\paragraph{Usage Notes}
It requires theory $z\-\_predicate\-\_calculus$.
It is not intended to be mixed with HOL proof contexts.
=ENDDOC

This proof context
will allow $strip\_tac$ to remain within the Z language
on each of its steps, though with the caveat noted in \ref{ZCAVEAT}.

$step\_strip\_tac$ is able to
leave the Z language, which it does for 
stripping
a Z existentially quantified antecedent to an implication.
However, 
=INLINEFT
REPEAT step_strip_tac
=TEX
{} will remain within the Z language if its argument starts there.
\subsection{Z Contradiction Tactics}
The tactics supplied for HOL contradiction tactics extend to Z without
change, if appropriate proof contexts are used.
