\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
derived rules of inference, conversions and tactics for
\ProductZ (see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD015}) predicate calculus.
This is called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD016}.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP041}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
initial set of rules, conversions and tactics for the predicate calculus of the \ProductZ.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Loading this document is dependent on 
the Z Language theory, started in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD052} and Z Paragraph processor
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD049}.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
The coverage in initial releases of \ProductZ{} is aimed at the basic reasoning
tools, rather than a full coverage.
Thus we aim only to cover:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Rewriting
\item
Stripping conclusions and theorems (including assumptions)
\item
$µ$ elimination as inference rule
\item
Contradiction tactics
\item
$¶\_tac$
\end{itemize}
plus some of the auxiliary functions necessary for implementing these.
Thus, initial releases of the ProofPower Z tools will be
deficient in many areas in which reasoning is supported
for HOL.
\section{OVERLAP WITH HOL}
Some functions operating on Z have the same purpose
as an equivalent for HOL,
but perhaps different functionality.

Where this happens we will:
\begin{itemize}
\item
By preference use the HOL function, with, if necessary, parameterisation
changes provided by proof contexts (or, more rarely,
if at all, by other parameterisation).
In particular, if the functionality is the same, use the 
same function (e.g. $±\_tac$).
\item
Otherwise we will provide a separately named function for Z work.
The Z name will usually be formed by prefixing by
``$z\_$'', ``$Z\_$'' or ``Z'' (according to naming convention case and atom composition rules
followed by the object's name)
to indicate the object of
concern in the Z variant of the object.
\end{itemize}
Later releases might provide structures whose sole purpose is to
override HOL (i.e. primary language) objects by
their Z equivalents, and to undo this step.
There are both benefits and problems with this, and the final
approach is yet to be decided.
\section{LANGUAGE OVERLAP BETWEEN Z AND HOL}\label{ZCAVEAT}
Many of the functions below that generate results involving expressions and predicates
are stated to ``remain within the Z language''
(indicated by their results being in $ñ\ ...\ ®$ or
left without any such brackets at all - this document assumes
Z as the default language, HOL terms are explicitly quoted).
This should be taken to mean that in so far as the original
input was within the Z language (i.e. the range of the Z mapping)
the results will also be
(except for certain renaming problems, etc).
This will be checked by some derivative of $is\_z$, unless
otherwise noted, informing the user
if Z has been left.
Later releases will use $Á\_to\_z\_conv$ to correct
what problems it can.

Legitimately, we use HOL universal quantification
to represent generic formals.
However we will also allow arbitrary outer HOL universal quantified terms to be considered ``within the Z language'' 
where this is convenient, though this is avoided where possible.

By default all relevant functions in this document should
be assumed to remain within the Z language and assumed to check this fact, unless otherwise stated.
\section{Z PREDICATE CALCULUS}
=DOC
signature ÛZPredicateCalculusÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
This provides a set of rules of inference, conversions and tactics sufficient for reasoning about the Z predicate calculus in ProofPower.
This structure declares the theory $z\_language\_ps$,
which is also used by structures $ZSetTheory$ and $ZSchemaCalculus$.
=ENDDOC
As theory $z\_set\_theory$ is also used by structure
$ZSetTheory$ we delay its theory design until 
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD042}.
\subsection{Subsidiary Functions}
\subsubsection{What is Z}
The following are extensions of work done in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD047},
and perhaps some of this material should be moved to that document.

Errors start with 4100.
=DOC
val Ûdest_z_term1Ý : TERM -> Z_TERM;
=DESCRIBE
This function acts as $dest\_z\_term$ on terms
(i.e. expressions and predicates)
in the Z language, but makes additional checks.
This is in contrast to $dest\_z\_term$ whose
intended purpose is categorisation and destruction of Z terms with minimal overhead.

The function does not recursively check the constituents of the outermost Z syntactic construction.
For example, it does not check that the constituents
of a Z $decl$ are individually in the syntactic category $dec$.
=FAILURE
41002	Not within the Z language due to subterm ?0
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûis_z_term1Ý : TERM -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
Tests if a given HOL term is valid Z in its top level structure.
=USES
Recursively in well-formedness checks.
=SEEALSO
$is\_z\_term$ for a less complete check of top level structure,
$is\_z$ for a full traversal of the terms structure.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûis_zÝ : TERM -> bool;
val Ûis_all_z_typeÝ : TYPE -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
If the term (i.e. expression or predicate) or type given is in the range of the Z mapping
for a term or type respectively
then these functions will return true.
They will otherwise return false, unless the
only form of incorrectness is
that the constituents of a Z syntactic construction
are not as required.
For example, it does not check that the constituents
of a Z $decl$ are individually in the syntactic category $dec$.

The test traverses the provided object 
by using $full\_dest\_z\-\_term$ (and $dest\_z\-\_type$ 
for constituenttypes) - the test is passed
if the entire term can be broken into non-type and non-term parts
(i.e. primitives such as strings or integers).
Otherwise it will fail with the given error message.

Note that a term is a subterm of itself for these purposes.
=SEEALSO
$is\_z\_term$ and $is\_z\_term1$.
=FAILURE
41002	Not within the Z language due to subterm ?0
41003	Not within the Z language due to containing type ?0
=ENDDOC
The above test is not complete because of not checking constituents, as indicated: later releases may
include a complete test for being Z.

We use the name $is\_all\_z\_type$ to distinguish
from the previously defined $is\_z\_type$.
=DOC
val Ûnot_z_subtermsÝ : TERM -> TERM list;
=DESCRIBE
This function will return a list (perhaps empty)
of all the subterms that prevent a term (i.e. expression or predicate) being within the
Z language (by the checks of $is\_z$, q.v.), starting with the rightmost subterm that is not Z.
The subterms given will be maximal in the sense that subterms of those given will not be included in the list.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
(* Ûcheck_is_zÝ : boolean flag *)

val Ûset_check_is_zÝ : bool -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
This flag, if true (the default), will cause all Z inference rules and tactics that claim to remain in the Z language
to check any terms they change (i.e. assumptions and conclusions) for remaining within the Z 
language.
If any fail then the informational message 41004 is used
to output text to the user.
If the flag is false, no such checks are made.
The checks are computationally expensive,
and the results may be excessively verbose if terms are not 
all Z.

The function sets the flag to a specified value and retursn the
original value.
=FAILURE
41004	The following subterms in the result are not in the Z language: ?0
=ENDDOC
Actually, the flag be defaulted to true during initial work,
it perhaps later should be defaulted to false.
=DOC
val Ûcheck_is_z_thmÝ : string -> THM -> THM;
val Ûcheck_is_z_goalÝ : string -> GOAL -> GOAL;
val Ûcheck_is_z_termÝ : string -> TERM -> TERM;
val ÛCHECK_IS_Z_TÝ : string -> TACTIC -> TACTIC;
val Ûcheck_is_z_conv_resultÝ : string -> THM -> THM;
=DESCRIBE
For $check\_is\_z\_thm$,
if flag $check\_is\_z$ is true then the conclusion and
assumptions of the provided theorem are checked for being 
within the Z language (except for outermost HOL universal quantification), and informational message 41005 used if not.
The string argument is used as the name of the calling function in the error message.
If the flag is false then there is no effect.
In either case the theorem is passed through unchanged.

$check\_is\_z\_goal$ and $check\_is\_z\_term$ are analogous.
$CHECK\-\_IS\-\_Z\-\_T$ checks each of the subgoals
a tactic requests.

$check\-\_is\-\_z\-\_conv\-\_result$ checks
that the RHS of the resulting equational theorem,
and any assumptions are within the
Z language.
This allows the RHS side of the equation to have outer HOL 
universal quantification, and the LHS not to be Z (e.g. in an Z introduction conversion) without complaint.
=FAILURE
41005	In the result of ?0 the following subterms are not in the Z language: ?1
=ENDDOC

\subsubsection{Representing HOL Types as Z Terms}
=DOC
val Ûz_term_of_typeÝ : TYPE -> TERM; 
val Ûz_type_ofÝ : TERM -> TERM; 
=DESCRIBE
=INLINEFT
z_term_of_type ty
=TEX
\  is a term denoting the set of all elements of the type $ty$.
The term is constructed using
=INLINEFT
mk_z_ð
=TEX
,
=INLINEFT
mk_z_¸
=TEX
,
=INLINEFT
mk_z_h_schema
=TEX
, given sets, and the relation symbol
=INLINEFT
_ ª _
=TEX
\ in order to display the structure of the type in a Z-like way.
=INLINEFT
mk_u
=TEX
\ is used when all else fails.

For example:
=GFT
z_term_of_type(type_of ñ§1, 2, 3¢®)			= ñú ª ú®
z_term_of_type(type_of ñ(1, 2, 3)®)			= ñú ¸ ú ¸ ú®
z_term_of_type(type_of ñ{1, 2, 3}®)			= ñð ú®
z_term_of_type(type_of ñ(a¦1, b¦2, c¦3)®)	= ña, b, c : ú®
z_term_of_type(type_of ¬[1; 2; 3]®)			= ñƒ®
=TEX
Note that the quotation in the last example contains an HOL list display,
the type of which, namely
=INLINEFT
”î LIST®
=TEX
, lies outside the representation of the Z type system in HOL.

$z\_type\_of$ returns the set of all elements of the (HOL) type of a particular term.
=GFT Definition
val z_type_of = z_term_of_type o type_of;
=TEX
=ENDDOC

\subsubsection{Adjustment after Á-conversion}
Errors start with 4110.

If a substitution via $var\_subst$ is made upon a term in Z (that may be
part of a theorem or subgoal) by the 
many important functions that call $var\_subst$
(e.g. rewriting and $µ$ elimination),
and if this substitution causes bound variable renaming, the
resulting term may no longer be in the Z language.
This may be because either the types of 
$decl$-style bindings
(see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/ZED002}, the section upon ``Variable Binding Constructs'') may no longer match the variable names bound,
or because the variables in the binding have ceased being in a canonical order.
Either of these two problems can be ``fixed'' by post-processing.
The problems may be adjusted back to Z by using
Z renaming constructs, reordering of quantifiers or by $Á$-conversion,
returning the term to being within
the Z language.

Other ProofPower functions, such as $inst$ may also cause
undesirable renaming.

The following two functions fulfill this need:
=DOC
val ÛÁ_to_zÝ : TERM -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
This function will adjust all sub-terms that fail to be 
Z because either:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The subterm involves a $decl$-style binding, and the type of the binding
does not match the names of the variables bound.
This is adjusted using the Z renaming construct.
\item
The subterm is a $decl$-style binding whose bound variables are not
in the canonical ordering that would result from the Z mapping.
This is adjusted by reorganising the order of abstractions and arguments.
\end{itemize}
If a HOL $Á$-conversion will suffice then that will be
used instead.

Subterms that are not covered by these two cases will be traversed and their own subterms checked, regardless of their language.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.
=SEEALSO
$Á\_to\_z\_conv$
=FAILURE
41100	No adjustment took place
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val ÛÁ_to_z_convÝ : CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This function will return the equality theorem between a term
and one that adjusts all sub-terms that fail to be 
Z because either:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The subterm is a $decl$-style binding, and the type of the binding
does not match the names of the variables bound.
This is adjusted using the Z renaming construct.
\item
The subterm is a $decl$-style binding whose bound variables are not
in the canonical ordering that would result from the Z mapping.
This is adjusted by reorganising the order of abstractions and arguments.
\end{itemize}
If a HOL $Á$-conversion will suffice then that will be
used instead.

Subterms that are not covered by these two cases will be traversed and their own subterms checked, regardless of their language.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.
=SEEALSO

\subsubsection{Concerning Generic Formals}
These are represented by HOL universals and may thus
be manipulated by $µ\_elim$, etc.

\subsection{Concerning the Universe, ƒ} \label{U}
Errors start with 4106.

In \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD078} the following definition is given.
 
¹ ƒ[X]œ
Ü ƒ : ð X
÷
Ü ƒ = X
ˆ

This definition is supplied purely for convenience. 
If a generic global variable appears without any supplied generic actuals then the variable is taken to be generic 
in $ñƒ®$.
This leads to terms which are polymorphic, rather than truly set generic. The following material about $ƒ$ is provided to facilitate discharging the proof obligation of implicit predicates in Z declarations.

=DOC
val Ûz__u_convÝ : CONV;
=DESCRIBE
Simplifies to $true$ a predicate of the forms:
=INLINEFT
ñx  S[ƒ]®
=TEX
{},  
=INLINEFT
ñx € S[ƒ]®
=TEX
{} or a schema as a predicate:
=INLINEFT
ñ[a,b: S[ƒ]; c : S'[ƒ]; ...]®
=TEX
{}, where
$S[ƒ]$, $S'[ƒ]$, ... are structures 
that can be simplified to $ƒ$.
This uses the application of the built-in
simplifications listed below, and conversions held in the ``icl$'$u$\_$simp'' entry of the dictionary of nets field of the current
proof context
(the built-in's taking precedence).
=FRULE 1 Conversion
z__u_conv
ñx  S[ƒ]®
÷
÷
ô x  S[ƒ] ¤ true
=TEX
=FRULE 1 Conversion
z__u_conv
ñx € S[ƒ]®
÷
÷
ô x € S[ƒ] ¤ true
=TEX
=FRULE 1 Conversion
z__u_conv
ñ[a,b: S[ƒ]; c : S'[ƒ]; ...]®
÷
÷
ô [a,b: S[ƒ]; c : S'[ƒ]; ...] ¤ true
=TEX
The conversion starts with the structure $S[ƒ]$ above.
It will attempt to recursively prove equal to $ƒ$:
the argument to $ð$,
the consitituent sets of a cartesian tuple,
the types of a declaration part of a set abstraction with a true predicate,
and the types of a declaration part of a horizontal schema with a true predicate.
If it can do so it will then use:
=GFT
ô ð ƒ = ƒ
ô (ƒ ¸ ƒ ¸ ...) = ƒ
ô {lab1 : ƒ; lab2 : ƒ; lab3,lab4 : ƒ; ... } = ƒ
ô [lab1 : ƒ; lab2 : ƒ; lab3,lab4 : ƒ; ... ] = ƒ
=TEX
to prove the set equal to $ƒ$.
If it cannot complete the above proof it will use the
first applicable conversion of the ``icl$'$u$\_$simp'' entry of the dictionary of nets field of the current
proof context,
and then return to attempting to use the built-in algorithm.

If the set has been reduced to $ƒ$ the conversion 
will prove the input term $true$.
If the expression cannot be proven the conversion fails.
=USES
For stripping in proof contexts, and in eliminating redundant declarations that have been
converted to the predicates implicit in them.
=SEEALSO

=FAILURE
41061	cannot prove ?0 equal to ñtrue®
41062	?0 is not of the form: ñx € s®, ñx  s® or a schema as a predicate
=ENDDOC
We have a mix of built-in and proof context functions in the
above two simplifiers primarily to allow one to simplify
schemas and the other not to.
However this approach is also helpful in efficiently recognising structures created by
generated constants (such as those for tuples, set abstractions and schemas).

$€$, according to Spivey is part of the Z library, but it
is defined in the Z language theory, and is used in the
implementation of declarations.
This use in declarations is precisely the one we most wish to simplify if it is $€\ ƒ$.

=DOC
val Ûu_simp_eqn_cxtÝ : THM list -> EQN_CXT;
=DESCRIBE
=INLINEFT
u_simp_eqn_cxt thms
=TEX
{} takes each member of $thms$,

The check is that each theorem is
canonicalised with the current proof context's canonicalisation
function.
For each resulting theorem, if it is a universally quantified equation of sets then it is processed by $thm\_eqn\_cxt$ and added into the created equational context.
If it is not equation of sets the theorem is ignored.
=USES

A theorem is checked by canonicalising it, and accepting

an expression that is not $ƒ$, and $ƒ$.
Those that can be so used are processed by $thm\-\_eqn\-\_cxt$

it will be ``aware'' of the equational contexts potential $ƒ$ simplifications.

For example, to make the current proof context aware of the $ƒ$ simplifications of the (in scope) theory ``thy'' one would do:
=GFT

set_u_simp_eqn_cxt (theory_u_simp_eqn_cxt "thy") "thy_u_simp_pc";
push_merge_pcs ("thy_u_simp_pc" :: other_desired_proof_contexts);

One could later update information about the theory
(e.g. because new definitions have been added) by:
=GFT

set_merge_pcs ("thy_u_simp_pc" :: other_desired_proof_contexts);

\subsection{Canonicalisation}

val Ûz_para_pred_canonÝ : CANON;
val Ûz_para_pred_convÝ : CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This canonicalisation function and conversion change
Z paragraphs to Z predicates. This change is also the one 
$z\_get\_spec$ does, where appropriate.

Some paragraphs entered by the Z parser have ``markers''
applied to the rest of the theorem body to indicate their origin (i.e. the kind of paragraph).
In addition the form of the term is likely to have a 
an explicit declaration as the left conjunct, rather than a ``predicate implicit in a declaration''.
$z\-\_para\-\_pred\-\_canon$ is a canonicalisation function that removes these markers and converts, if present,
a left conjunct declaration as 
$z\_decl\_pred\_conv$ would;
$z\-\_para\-\_pred\-\_conv$ is a conversion that has the equivalent effect.

The following are instances in which markers are used:
=GFT

=DOC
val Ûz_get_specÝ : TERM -> THM;
=DESCRIBE
This function returns the specification of a constant, based
on its definiting theorem and, if one can be found, a consistency theorem.
The defining theorem may have been created by
Z paragraph processing, $new\_axiom$, or a HOL definitional mechanism. 
This function should be the Z user's interface to definitional theorems, as $get\_spec$(q.v.) is for the HOL user.

$z\_get\_spec$ $¬const®$ will find the (first) definition or axiom in scope
stored under key ``name of $const$'', in the theory in which the in-scope constant named $const$ was defined.
A definition will be taken in preference to an axiom in the same theory.
$z\_get\_spec$ $¬const\ t1\ t2\ ...®$ (i.e. a constant applied
to an arbitrary number of arguments in HOL)
will act as $z\_get\_spec$ $¬const®$.
This choice is made in the assumption that a naming convention
has been followed that such a definition (or axiom) should be the definition of the constant named $const$.
This convention has been followed throughout the implementation of \Product{}.
In addition, there can only be one definition of a particular constant in scope (though the conventional key might be used elsewhere, or not at all).
If there is no such constant in scope, or no definition with the given key, then the function fails.

If the definitional theorem is of the form:
=GFT
ô ConstSpec p c
=TEX
(i.e. its introduction requires a consistency assumption)
the function will seek for a theorem or axiom stored with key
$const$ $\verb"^"$ ``$\_consistent$'', starting at the theory in which the definition was found, and working ``out'' to the current theory.
If conventions have been followed this theorem should be of the form:
=GFT
‡ ô Consistent p
=TEX
(Ideally there should be no assumptions in the theorem, but
the function caters for their presence.)
If a theorem of this form is found then the theorem:
=GFT
Â_rule `‡ ô p c`
=TEX
is formed.
If not, then the theorem:
=GFT
Â_rule `Consistent p ô p c`
=TEX
is formed.
In all of the above cases, (i.e. with or without $ConstSpec$),
the theorem formed is checked to see whether it
is the definiton formed from processing a Z paragraph.
If so, then the conclusion of the theorem is
converted into a predicate
(by $z\_para\_pred\_conv$), and then returned as the result of
$z\_get\_spec$.
If not, then the theorem is returned without further
processing as result of 
$z\_get\_spec$.

and is a reasonable, general-purpose, automatic proof tactic
for Z.

In summary it will:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Attempt variable elimination, using $all\_var\_elim\_asm\_tac$.
\item
Extract the assumption list, rewrite each extracted assumption with the current
default rewrite rules and given theorems, and strip the results back into the assumption list.
\item
Attempt to rewrite the conclusion of the resulting goal with the current
default rewrite rules and given theorems.
\item
Repeatedly apply $strip\_tac$ to the conclusions of the resulting goals.
\item
Again attempt variable elimination, using $all\_var\_elim\_asm\_tac$.
\item
In all resulting goals replace all Z quantifiers by their HOL equivalents in both assumptions and goal. 
This has no effect on any resulting goal if it is unsolved.
\item
Apply $all\_asm\_fc\_tac$ once to each resulting goal.
\item
Attempt to prove each of the resulting goals with resolution for up to 3 resolution steps, with goal's negated conclusion
as a resolvant that must be used, and the assumptions as possible
other resolvants.
This has no effect on any resulting goal if it is unsolved.
\item
Attempt to prove each of the resulting goals with resolution for up to 3 resolution steps amongst
just the assumptions.
This has no effect on any resulting goal if it is unsolved.
\end{enumerate}

Note that either stripping step may result in more than one subgoal, and thus the plural ``resulting goals''.

Under the current interface to
resolution this is
=GFT
fun z_basic_prove_tac thms =
TRY_T all_var_elim_asm_tac THEN
DROP_ASMS_T (MAP_EVERY (strip_asm_tac o rewrite_rule thms) o rev) THEN

The ``3 resolution steps'' is a fixed number of steps, chosen as a compromise between finding all possible resolution proofs
and the costs of such attempts.
For finer tuning, use the resolution package more directly.
=DOC
val Ûz_basic_prove_convÝ : THM list -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This is the conversion used for the automatic proof conversion ($pr\_tac$ field) of most
supplied proof contexts,
and is a reasonable, general-purpose, automatic proof conversion.
It will either prove the theorem with the given conclusion, or fail.

In summary it will:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Set the term as the goal of the subgoal package
(or, more exactly, $tac\_proof$).
\item
Attempt to rewrite the term with the current
default rewrite rules and given theorems.
\item
Repeatedly apply $strip\_tac$ to the goal.
\item
Attempt variable elimination, using $all\_var\_elim\_asm\_tac$.
\item
In all resulting goals replace all Z quantifiers by their HOL equivalents in both assumptions and goal.
\item
Apply $all\_asm\_fc\_tac$ once to each resulting goal.
\item
Attempt to prove the resulting goals with resolution for up to 3 resolution steps, with goal's negated conclusion
as a resolvant that must be used, and the assumptions as possible
other resolvants.
\item
Attempt to prove the resulting goals with resolution for up to 3 resolution steps amongst
just the assumptions.
\item
If the proof is successful, return 
=INLINEFT
ô term ¤ T
=TEX
{} and otherwise fail.
\end{enumerate}

Note that in the stripping step may result in more than one subgoal, and thus the phrase ``resulting goals'' is used above.

Under the current interface to
resolution this is equivalent to:
=GFT
fun z_basic_prove_conv thms tm =
¤_t_intro (
tac_proof(([],tm),
	TRY_T (rewrite_tac thms)  THEN 
	REPEAT strip_tac THEN
	TRY_T all_var_elim_asm_tac THEN
	(z_quantifiers_elim_tac THEN
	basic_res_tac2 3 [ô µ x · x = x] 
	ORELSE_T basic_res_tac3 3 [ô µ x · x = x]))
);

In the implementation however, partial evaluation with just the theorems is allowed.

The resolution-based proof procedure

=INLINEFT
z_fc_prove_tac

chaining (in the sense of
=INLINEFT
fc_tac
=TEX
.
It is supplied as the automatic proof tactic field in the proof
context
=INLINEFT
'z_fc
=TEX
. Its effect may be described as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Attempt variable elimination, using $all\_var\_elim\_asm\_tac$.
\item
Extract the assumption list, rewrite each assumption as it is extracted
with the current
default rewrite rules and given theorems, and strip the results back into the assumption list.
\item
Attempt to rewrite the conclusions of the resulting goals  with the current
default rewrite rules and the argument theorems.
\item
Apply $contr\_tac$.
\item
Again attempt variable elimination, using $all\_var\_elim\_asm\_tac$.
\item
In all resulting goals replace all Z quantifiers by their HOL equivalents. 
\item
Apply $all\_asm\_fc\_tac$.
\item
Generate (universally quantified) implications from the assumptions
using the canonicalisation function
=INLINEFT
fc_canon1
=TEX
. The go through three forward chaining passes (in the sense of
=INLINEFT
fc_tac
=TEX
) using these implications as a starting point. At the end of each pass
any generated results are both stripped into the assumptions and processed
with
=INLINEFT
fc_canon1
=TEX
\ to be passed on as additional implications for the subsequent pass.
\end{enumerate}

For example, the tactic will prove the following goal:
=GFT
([], ñ
	(µ x1 : ú · x1  A ´ x1  B) ±
	(µ x1 : ƒ; x2 : ƒ · (x1, x2)  B ò x ¤ (x1, x2)  B ò x') ±

(as opposed to the mathematical tool-kit).
It is composed of proof contexts ``$'$z$\_$predicates''

(* Proof Context: Û'z_predicatesÝ *)
=DESCRIBE
A component proof context for handling the requirements of the Z predicates of the Z language
(as opposed to the mathematical tool-kit).
It remains purely within the Z language, and thus lacks the
features found in proof context ``$'$z$\_$decl''
which are necessary for a complete treatment of Z predicates.
(which may be found in proof context ``z$\_$predicates'').

Predicates treated by this proof context are constructs formed from:
=GFT
 =, ³, ±, ², ´, ¤, ƒ, µ D | P · V, ¶ D | P · V, ¶‰1 D | P · V
=TEX
This proof context further handles membership of constructs
purely contructed from $ƒ$, generic formals,
and Z paragraph markers.
The language predicate $$ is treated with the set constructs
that it expresses membership of.
Schemas (and especially schema references) as predicates
are treated by ``z$\_$schemas'',
except that this proof context will replace an ill-formed ``schema as predicate'' expression with an explicit membership.

\paragraph{Usage Notes}
It requires theory $z\-\_language\-\_ps$.
It is not intended to be mixed with HOL proof contexts.
Use with proof context ``$'$z$\_$decl'' to handle declarations
properly.
=ENDDOC

This proof context
will allow $strip\_tac$ to remain within the Z language
on each of its steps, though with the caveat noted in \ref{ZCAVEAT}.

$step\_strip\_tac$ is able to
leave the Z language, which it does for 
stripping
a Z existentially quantified antecedent to an implication.
However, 
=INLINEFT
REPEAT step_strip_tac
=TEX
{} will remain within the Z language if its argument starts there.

Note that rewriting does not expand Z $¶‰1$-terms, nor does stripping the conclusion.

The proof context does not concern itself with schema references,
though these are Z language predicates.

Treating the universal set, $ƒ$, in this proof context is 
apparently not in keeping with the context's theme,
but it is useful to handle trivial quantifier
declarations. Such material could be moved to proof context ``$'$z$\_$decl''.

=DOC
(* Proof Context: Û'z_declÝ *)
=DESCRIBE
A component proof context for handling the requirements of converting Z declarations into their implicit predicates, kept separate from ``$'$z$\_$predicates'' due to it introducing a small 
portion of Z library set theoretic reasoning.

The requirement is met by appropriate treatment of:

(* Proof Context: Û'z_fcÝ *)
=DESCRIBE
A component proof context giving a faster but less general automatic
proof capability than the one supplied in most other proof contexts
for Z.
The automatic proof procedures in the proof context
are $z\-\_fc\-\_prove\-\_tac$, $z\-\_fc\-\_prove\-\_conv$.
All other fields are blank.

\paragraph{Usage Notes}
It requires theory $z\-\_language\-\_ps$.

Note that the way proof contexts are merged by

=TEX
\ is such that to get the faster automatic proof procedures, one should
put
=INLINEFT
'z_fc

\ at the end of the list of proof contexts to be merged.
For example, to work in the Z predicate calculus with the faster
automatic proof procedures, one might use
=GFT
push_merge_pcs["z_predicates", "'z_fc"];
