* General Help 
.LP
Welcome to Xpp - the ProofPower X/Motif Interface.

Xpp provides a convenient way to prepare, check and execute ProofPower scripts. 
It combines a general purpose text editor with a command interface for operating the ProofPower system.
When running with the command interface enabled, the Xpp main window has four areas:
.IP "Menu Bar" 20
This contains menus which you use to select the main editing and ProofPower command functions.
.IP "File Name Bar" 20
This contains the name of the file from which the script you are editing comes.
It also tells you when you have made changes to the script.
.IP "Script Window" 20
This is the Motif text window in which the script is edited.
.IP "Journal Window" 20
This displays a journal of your transactions with ProofPower.

.LP
You probably brought up this help window using the General command from 
the Help menu on the right of the Menu Bar.
.LP
You can get more help using the other items in the Help menu.

* File Menu

This menu is used to save the text in the script window into a file or to read a file in. It is also used to finish an editing session.
.LP
The commands in this menu ending in `...' bring up a dialogue box which you use to choose the name of a file to work on. 
The other commands either don't need a file name or work on the file whose name  appears in the File Name Bar.
.LP
The commands will ask for confirmation before taking any action which could  lose your work.

.IP "Save" 24
saves all the text into the file named in the File Name Bar.

.IP "Save As..." 24
saves all the text into a file that you choose and puts the name of the file in the File Name Bar for future reference.

.IP "Save Selection As..." 24
saves only the text you have selected (e.g. by holding down the left mouse button and dragging) and doesn't change the File Name Bar.

.IP "Open..." 24
opens the file that you choose and puts the name of the file in the File Name Bar for future reference.

.IP "Include..." 24
copies text in from a file that you choose; the text is copied in just after the cursor (flashing vertical line) in the script window;
the File Name Bar doesn't change

.IP "Revert" 24
is just like opening the file whose name is in the File Name Bar; this is often useful for undoing a large batch of unintended changes

.IP "Empty File" 24
discards the text in the script window and puts a dummy name into the File Name Bar

.IP "Quit" 24
finishes your editing session 
.LP
* Tools Menu
.LP
This menu is used to start up various editing and command interface tools which run in windows of their own.
.IP "Search and Replace" 24
brings up a tool which lets you search for a pattern in your script, and if you wish, replace some or all instances of the pattern with some other text.
The tool can also be used to navigate round the script using line numbers.
.IP "Palette" 24
brings up a palette of mathematical and other symbols.
The palette is an array of push-buttons;
pushing a button inserts the character drawn on the button into your script just as if you had typed it in at the keyboard.
.IP "Templates" 24
The templates tool is an array of push-buttons;
pushing a button inserts a sequence of characters into your script corresponding to the symbol drawn on the button, as if you had typed the characters in at the keyboard.
.IP "Options" 24
brings up a tool which lets you adjust various settings which affect the behaviour of Xpp.
For example, you can say whether or not you want the editor to take a back up of a file before overwriting it when you use the save command in the file menu.
.IP "Command Line" 24
invokes a tool for running ProofPower commands which you do not want to have in your script.
(This tool is not available in a stand-alone editor).
.LP
* Edit Menu
.LP
This menu is used for the following editing functions, most of which operate on the X/Motif clipboard (a means of passing fragments of text around between applications or within one application).

.IP "Cut" 10
moves the text you have selected out of your script into the clipboard
.IP "Copy" 10
copies the text you have selected to the clipboard. This doesn't change the script
.IP "Paste" 10
copies the text on the clipboard into your document
.IP "Clear" 10
deselects any text you have selected. This doesn't change the script.
.IP "Undo/Redo" 10
undoes the last editing operation you carried out.
.LP
* Command Menu
.LP
This menu is used to pass commands to ProofPower.
These commands will prompt you if the effect is likely to lose some of your work.
The command menu is not provided in a stand-alone editor.
.IP "Execute" 16
sends the text you have selected to be executed as a ProofPower command.
.IP "Return" 16
sends a carriage return character.
.IP "Interrupt" 16
sends an interrupt signal.
.IP "Kill" 16
sends a kill signal.
.IP
