.\" Help texts for the X/Motif ProofPower Interface.
.\" This file is used to construct a C header file help.h
.\" containing definitions of C strings for use as help texts.
.\" The makefile uses the shell script makehelp to do this.
.\" The format of a help item is
.\"
.\" * <title>
.\" <any old nroff -ms stuff containing no lines beginning with an asterisk>
.\"
.\"
.\" Ideally, there would be a way of persuading nroff -ms to behave as
.\" if there was only one very long page. However the best you can
.\" do is 136 inches. Occasionally one will need to do .bp to avoid
.\" an infelicitous blank line. The shell script removes duplicate blank
.\" lines so there is not much harm in putting the .bp in.
.\" Since removing the blank lines is slow and very long help texts
.\" should be avoided we go for a smaller length below: this means you
.\" should check for unwanted blank lines if you add a new long section.
.\" The following command is useful if you just want to see the help texts
.\" on paper.

* About Xpp
.LP
Welcome to Xpp - the ProofPower X/Motif Interface.
.LP
Xpp provides a convenient way to prepare, check and execute ProofPower scripts.
It combines a general purpose text editor with a command interface for operating the ProofPower system.

* Using Help
.LP
Help is available from the Help menu in the Main Window and from the
Help push-buttons in other windows in xpp.
.LP
You can dismiss this Help Window when you have finished by clicking on
the push-button labelled Dismiss. You do not need to dismiss the
Help Window before using other parts of xpp; instead you can resize
or move the window, if necessary, to prevent it obscuring what you want to
work on and then carry on as normal.
.LP
If you are unfamiliar with using Motif or similar applications, the
Tutorial item in the Main Window Help menu contains information which
will help you make a start. You may also wish to consult your local
user documentation for Motif, which will give further information on
keyboard shortcuts etc.
.LP
Use the vertical scroll bar to the side of the help text to move around in the text.
The simplest way to do this is to use the triangular arrows at the top
and bottom of the scroll-bar.
Click Button 1 (usually the left mouse button)
on the bottom arrow to move down, and on the top arrow to move up.
Many keyboards have PageUp and PageDown keys or arrow keys
which can also be used to move around in a text area like this one.
You may have to click button 1 on the help window first to get this to work.

* Tutorial
.LP
This help text introduces the more important features of xpp.

The Motif look and feel which xpp supports offers many shortcuts,
and only a few of the more useful techniques are mentioned below.
Consult your local Motif user documentation or just experiment
to find out more.
.LP
--- Starting Xpp ---
.LP
Use a UNIX command line like one of the following to begin a session with xpp:
.IP "xpp -file myfile.doc" 8
.IP "xpp -file myfile.doc -command pp -d example_hol" 8
.IP "xpp -display server1:0 -fi myfile.doc -co pp -d example_hol" 8
.LP
The line without the `-command' (or `-co') gives an xpp session
running the editor only on file `myfile.doc'.
The other two command lines give the command interface as well
and use it to connect to a ProofPower session (invoked as `pp -d example_hol').

Edit-only and command interface sessions with xpp are very similar.
The edit-only sessions have a subset of the features of the command interface.

.LP
--- Main Window ---
.LP
In a command interface session, the xpp Main Window has four main areas.
Working from top to bottom, these are as follows:
.IP "Menu Bar" 20
This contains menus which you use to select the main editing and ProofPower command functions.
There are items in the Help Menu to give more information on each of these menus.
.IP "File Name Bar" 20
This contains the name of the file from which the script you are editing comes.
It also tells you when you have made changes to the script.
.IP "Script Window" 20
This is the Motif text area in which the script is entered and edited.
This offers a general purpose editor whose operation is introduced
later in this help text.
.IP "Journal Window" 20
This displays a journal of your transactions with ProofPower.
The basic technique for executing a ProofPower command is to
select some text in the Script Window and then use Execute Selection
from the Command Menu.
.LP
In an edit-only session, there are only three areas in
the Main Window: the Journal Window does not appear.
.LP
--- Mouse Buttons ---
.LP
Xpp works with a mouse or other pointing device with two or three buttons.
The third button is not usually used for xpp.
The two buttons which are used are:
.IP "Button 1" 10
This is usually the left button and is sometimes labelled `SELECT'.
It is often used for making selections, and for activating menus, menu items
and push-buttons.
.IP "Button 2" 10
This is usually the centre button and is sometimes labelled `ADJUST'
or `TRANSFER'.
It is often used to copy and move text.
It is also used, e.g., in scroll bars, in a similar way to Button 1 but
sometimes with a different effect.
.LP
You may like to experiment with the two mouse buttons in the scroll bar for
this help text to see how they differ.
.LP
--- Paned Windows ---
.LP
Some windows which xpp provides comprise several resizable elements stacked
vertically.
The elements of these `paned' windows are separated by a horizontal line with
a small square button, called a `sash'.
The Search Tool is an example of a paned window.

You can resize a resizable element in a paned window by holding Button 1
down over the sash and dragging it up or down.

Unfortunately, because of limitations in the Motif software,
sashes are sometimes displayed for elements which cannot be resized.
.LP
--- Text Areas ---
.LP
Xpp provides a number of text areas in which you can enter and edit text.
The most important of these is the Script Window (the uppermost large text
area in the main window).
There are also text areas like this Help Text and the Journal Window in
which xpp displays information but which are read-only: you can't enter
text into them directly. You can usually copy text out of these
read-only text areas using some of the techniques described under
`Operations on Text Selections' below.
.LP
In conjunction with the File Menu, the Edit Menu and the tools provided by the Tools Menu, the Script Window provides a general purpose text editor.
.LP
Text areas also feature in other windows such as the Search Tool,
in which you can type search and replace patterns, and the file selection dialog
in which you can type in file names.
Basic typing and editing operations are similar in all of the text areas.
.LP
--- Entering Text ---
.LP
To insert text, click Button 1 on the point at which you
want the text to begin.
A thin vertical line (called the I-beam cursor) will flash at the insertion
point you have selected.
You can now type at the keyboard to enter text.
.LP
The simplest way to correct mistakes is to use the Backspace key or the Delete key.
The Backspace key deletes the character just before the I-beam cursor and
the Delete key deletes the one just after it.
.LP
Mathematical and other symbols may also be entered, very much as if
you had typed them at the keyboard using the Palette Tool and the Template Tool. See the help item for the Tools Menu for more information on these
tools.
.LP
--- Undoing Text Changes ---
.LP
Undo in the Edit Menu can be be used to correct errors.
Undo will undo the effect of all the typing you did since you last
started typing at a new insertion point.

You can reverse the effect of an Undo, by selecting Redo from the Edit Menu.
.LP
--- Making Text Selections ---
.LP
You generally carry out more complex editing operations which operate on a
block of text by first selecting the text to operate on.
To select some text press Button 1 down at one end of the text you
want to select, then, holding the button down, drag the pointer to the other
end of the selection and release the button.
The selected text will become highlighted.
.LP
When you have made a selection you can grow or shrink it by holding down the
Shift key and clicking Button 1 where you want the new end-point to be.
.LP
You can quickly select a word or a line by double- or triple-clicking, but
quadruple clicking does not select the entire text.
The entire text can quickly be selected using the keyboard by pressing the `/' key
while holding the Control key down.
.LP
--- Operations on Text Selections ---
.LP
Having made a selection there are several things you can do with
the selected text. Some of the more common ones use the Clipboard:
an off-screen area where text can be stored.
You can retrieve text from the Clipboard by clinking Button 1 on the
point where you want the text to appear and pressing the Paste key.
Some of the more common operations on selections are:

.IP "Delete" 20
Press the Backspace key or the Delete key and the
whole selection will be deleted.
.IP "Overtype" 20
Type at the keyboard and what you type will replace
the selection.
.IP "Copy to Clipboard" 20
Press the Copy key and the selection will be copied
into an off-screen area called the Clipboard.
.IP "Cut to Clipboard" 20
Press the Cut key to combine the effects of Copy
and Delete: Cut deletes the text while also copying
it to the Clipboard.
.IP "Quick Copy" 20
Move the pointer away from the selection then press Button 2, and the
text will be copied to the new pointer position.
This lets you copy the selection from one text area to another, or within
one text area without using the Clipboard.
.LP
In the Script Window, the Edit Menu may also be used for
Cut, Copy and Paste operations, if you prefer.
.LP
Motif text areas provide several other operations with selections
Consult your local Motif user documentation for further information.

.LP
* File Menu
.LP
This menu is used to save the text in the Script Window into a file or to read a file in. It is also used to finish an editing session.
.LP
The commands in this menu ending in `...' bring up a File Selection Box which you use to choose the name of a file to work on.
The other commands either don't need a file name or work on the file whose name appears in the File Name Bar.
.LP
The commands will ask for confirmation before taking any action which could lose your work.
.IP "Save" 24
saves all the text into the file named in the File Name Bar.
.IP "Save As..." 24
saves all the text into a file that you choose and puts the name of the file in the File Name Bar for future reference.
.IP "Save Selection As..." 24
saves only the text you have selected (e.g. by holding down the Button 1 and dragging) and doesn't change the File Name Bar.
.IP "Open..." 24
opens the file that you choose and puts the name of the file in the File Name Bar for future reference.
.IP "Include..." 24
copies text in from a file that you choose; the text is copied in just after the I-beam cursor in the Script Window;
the File Name Bar doesn't change.
.IP "Revert" 24
is just like opening the file whose name is in the File Name Bar; this is often useful for undoing a large batch of unintended changes.
.IP "Empty File" 24
discards the text in the Script Window and puts a dummy name into the File Name Bar.

.IP "Quit" 24
finishes your editing session.
.bp
.LP
* Tools Menu
.LP
This menu is used to start up various editing and command interface tools which run in windows of their own.
.IP "Search and Replace" 24
brings up a tool which lets you search for a pattern in your script, and if you wish, replace some or all instances of the pattern with some other text.
The tool can also be used to navigate round the script using line numbers.
.IP "Palette" 24
brings up a palette of mathematical and other symbols.
The palette is an array of push-buttons;
pressing a push-button inserts the character drawn on it into your script just as if you had typed it in at the keyboard.
The palette may also be used to insert symbols into other text areas such as the one in the Command Line Tool using a technique called `drag-and-drop'.
To do this, hold Button 2 down over the symbol you want, move the pointer to where you want to insert the symbol, and release Button 2.  
.IP "Templates" 24
is used for easy entry of constructs such as Z paragraphs.
The templates tool is an array of push-buttons;
pressing a push-button inserts a sequence of characters into your script corresponding to the symbol drawn on it, as if you had typed the characters in at the keyboard.
This menu item may be greyed out (see note below).
.IP "Options" 24
brings up a tool which lets you adjust various settings which affect the behaviour of xpp.
For example, you can say whether or not you want the editor to take a back up of a file before overwriting it when you use the save command in the file menu.
.IP "Command Line" 24
invokes a tool for running ProofPower commands which you do not want to have in your script.
(This tool is not available in a stand-alone editor).
.LP
Note: the Templates Tool is set up from the applications defaults
file for xpp (e.g. see the ProofPower Reference Manual entry for xpp).
The Templates menu item will be greyed out, and the Templates Tool will not be
available, if the applications defaults file does not contain an appropriate
setting for the `templates' resource.
.bp
.LP
* Edit Menu
.LP
This menu is used for the following editing functions, some of which operate on the Clipboard (a means of passing text around between applications or within one application).

.IP "Cut" 12
moves the text you have selected out of your script to the Clipboard.
.IP "Copy" 12
copies the text you have selected to the Clipboard. This doesn't change the script.
.IP "Paste" 12
copies the text on the Clipboard into your document.
.IP "Clear" 12
deselects any text you have selected. This doesn't change the script or the Clipboard.
.IP "Undo/Redo" 12
undoes the last editing operation you carried out.
.bp
.LP
* Command Menu
.LP
You can use this menu to pass commands to ProofPower, if you are running
a command interface session of xpp (i.e., you have specified a `-command'
argument on the command line).
This menu is not provided in an edit-only session.

Xpp will prompt you if the effect of a menu item is likely to lose some of your work.

The menu items work as follows:

.IP "Execute Selection" 20
sends the text you have selected to be executed as a ProofPower command.
Depending on a setting you can adjust with the Options Tool, a carriage
return character may be sent after the text, if it does not already end
with one.
.IP "Return" 20
sends a carriage return character.
.IP "Semicolon" 20
sends a semicolon followed by a carriage return character.
This is often convenient for finishing off lines of Standard ML.
.IP "Abandon" 20
gives a convenient way of abandoning a ProofPower computation.
It sends an interrupt signal and then waits for a prompt from ProofPower;
when the prompt is received it replies with a command to
cause ProofPower to abandon what it is currently executing.
.IP "Interrupt" 20
sends an interrupt signal.
ProofPower will respond with an interrupt prompt `=>'
You can then send commands to tell ProofPower how to proceed
Send a `?' to see a list of available commands.
.IP "Kill" 20
sends a kill signal.
This will cause the ProofPower session to be terminated and will lose
any work which you have not saved.
.IP "Restart" 20
restarts the ProofPower session.
This will cause the current ProofPower session to be terminated and will lose
any work which you have not saved.
.bp
.LP
* Search Tool
.LP
You can use this tool to search for patterns in the Script Window.
It also lets you replace some or all occurrences of a pattern
with replacement text and navigate around the text using line numbers.

The tool provides a number of push-buttons and three text areas.
The uppermost text area is where you enter the search pattern.
The other large text area is for any replacement text.
The small text area at the bottom is used to hold a line number.
The push-buttons work as follows:

.IP "<= Search" 16
starts a `backwards' search: it looks for the first occurrence of the search pattern before the I-beam cursor in the Script Window.
If the pattern is found, it will be selected (highlighted) in the Script Window.
.IP "Search =>" 16
starts a `forwards' search: it looks for the first occurrence of the pattern after the cursor.
.IP ":= Selection" 16
copies the current selection (if any) from the Script Window into
the text area immediately below.
.IP "Replace" 16
causes the current selection in the Script Window to be replaced by
the contents of the replacement text area.
.IP "Replace All" 16
causes all occurrences of the search pattern to be replaced by the replacement
text.
.IP "Goto line" 16
causes the Script Window to move to the line whose number is in
the line number area.
.IP ":= Cursor" 16
causes the number of the line in the Script Window containing the cursor
to be placed in the line number area.
.IP "Dismiss" 16
hides the Search Tool from view. You can bring it back by
selecting the Search and Replace item in the Tools Menu again.
.IP "Help" 16
displays this help text.
.bp
.LP
* Options Tool
.LP
You can use this tool to check or alter various settings
which control the way xpp works.

The tool contains several text areas (in which you type textual or
numeric values) and several toggle buttons (small square or lozenge
shaped push-buttons which you operate by pressing with Button 1).

Commentary is provided alongside each text area or toggle button
to explain its purpose.

A setting controlled by a toggle button is on when it is black
and off when it is white.

The tool also has four push-buttons in a row at the bottom which work
as follows:
.IP "Apply" 16
brings the settings you have entered into force.
.IP "Reset" 16
puts the settings back to those which applied when xpp was first started.
.IP "Dismiss" 16
hides the Options Tool from view. You can bring it back by
selecting the Options item in the Tools Menu again.
.IP "Help" 16
displays this help text.
.bp
.LP
* Command Line Tool
.LP
You can use this tool to execute command lines which you do not wish to
save in the script you are editing.

The tool comprises three parts:
.IP "1" 4
A list which is used to remember commands you wish to execute
frequently.
Since the list and the individual commands may be quite long this list has
vertical and horizontal scroll bars.
A sample of useful commands is provided when you first bring up the
tool.
.IP "2" 4
A text area to hold a command line ready for execution.
You can type directly into this text area or you can fetch
one of the items in the list above by double-clicking on the item you want.
Typing return in this text area causes the command to be executed
(as does the Execute push-button).
.IP "3" 4
A row of push-buttons, for use in executing commands, editing the list, etc.
.LP
The push-buttons work as follows:
.IP "Execute" 16
causes the command in the text area to be executed.
.IP "Add" 16
adds the command in the text area to the end of the list.
.IP "Delete" 16
removes the selected (highlighted) item from the list.
.IP "Dismiss" 16
hides the Command Line Tool from view. You can bring it back by
selecting the Command Line item in the Tools Menu again.
.IP "Help" 16
displays this help text.
.bp
.LP
* File Selection Box
.LP
The File Selection Box appears when xpp needs you to tell it the name of a file.
.LP
WARNING: When the File Selection Box is on the screen, other parts of xpp, including
the Help Window's scroll bar and Dismiss button, are not usually active.
If you want to keep the File Selection Box visible and cannot read all of
this help text, try resizing the help window.
.LP
The simplest way to use the File Selection Box
is just to type a file name into Selection text area and
then press the push-button at the bottom left (labelled with the operation
in the File Menu which xpp is carrying out).
Xpp will then take the name you typed as the name of the file to work with.

Pressing the Cancel button dismisses the File Selection Box and
abandons the file operation xpp was trying to
carry out.

It is often convenient to let the File Selection Box help you
find the file name you want.
If you click on a name in the Files list, the name will
appear in the Selection and you can carry on as if you had just typed
it there.

The Filter text area lets you do pattern-matching searches for file names.
If you type `/home/me/*' into the Filter text area and then press the push-button
labelled `Filter', the names of all the files in directory `/home/me'
will appear in the Files list, and all names of all the directories
in the directory `/home' will appear in the Directories list.
If you had typed `/home/me/*.doc' into the Filter text area, then only
files with names ending in `*.doc' would be shown in the Files list.

Clicking on a directory name replaces the directory part of the
Filter text area with the directory name.

* Templates Tool
.LP
The buttons in the templates tool enter templates for language constructs into the Script Window as described below:
