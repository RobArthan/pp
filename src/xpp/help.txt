.\" an infelicitous blank line. The shell script removes duplicate blank
.\" lines so there is not much harm in putting the .bp in.

* General Help 
.LP
Welcome to Xpp - the ProofPower X/Motif Interface.

Xpp provides a convenient way to prepare, check and execute ProofPower scripts. 
It combines a general purpose text editor with a command interface for operating the ProofPower system.
When running with the command interface enabled, the Xpp main window has four areas:
.IP "Menu Bar" 20
This contains menus which you use to select the main editing and ProofPower command functions.
.IP "File Name Bar" 20
This contains the name of the file from which the script you are editing comes.
It also tells you when you have made changes to the script.
.IP "Script Window" 20
This is the Motif text window in which the script is edited.
.IP "Journal Window" 20
This displays a journal of your transactions with ProofPower.

.LP
You probably brought up this help window using the General command from 
the Help menu on the right of the Menu Bar.
.LP
You can get more help using the other items in the Help menu.

* File Menu

This menu is used to save the text in the script window into a file or to read a file in. It is also used to finish an editing session.
.LP
The commands in this menu ending in `...' bring up a dialogue box which you use to choose the name of a file to work on. 
The other commands either don't need a file name or work on the file whose name  appears in the File Name Bar.
.LP
The commands will ask for confirmation before taking any action which could  lose your work.

.IP "Save" 24
saves all the text into the file named in the File Name Bar.

.IP "Save As..." 24
saves all the text into a file that you choose and puts the name of the file in the File Name Bar for future reference.

.IP "Save Selection As..." 24
saves only the text you have selected (e.g. by holding down the left mouse button and dragging) and doesn't change the File Name Bar.

.IP "Open..." 24
opens the file that you choose and puts the name of the file in the File Name Bar for future reference.

.IP "Include..." 24
copies text in from a file that you choose; the text is copied in just after the cursor (flashing vertical line) in the script window;
the File Name Bar doesn't change

.IP "Revert" 24
is just like opening the file whose name is in the File Name Bar; this is often useful for undoing a large batch of unintended changes

.IP "Empty File" 24
discards the text in the script window and puts a dummy name into the File Name Bar

.IP "Quit" 24
finishes your editing session 
.LP
* Tools Menu
.LP
This menu is used to start up various editing and command interface tools which run in windows of their own.
.IP "Search and Replace" 24
brings up a tool which lets you search for a pattern in your script, and if you wish, replace some or all instances of the pattern with some other text.
The tool can also be used to navigate round the script using line numbers.
.IP "Palette" 24
brings up a palette of mathematical and other symbols.
The palette is an array of push-buttons;
pushing a button inserts the character drawn on the button into your script just as if you had typed it in at the keyboard.
.IP "Templates" 24
is used for easy entry of constructs such as Z paragraphs.
The templates tool is an array of push-buttons;
pushing a button inserts a sequence of characters into your script corresponding to the symbol drawn on the button, as if you had typed the characters in at the keyboard.
.IP "Options" 24
brings up a tool which lets you adjust various settings which affect the behaviour of Xpp.
For example, you can say whether or not you want the editor to take a back up of a file before overwriting it when you use the save command in the file menu.
.IP "Command Line" 24
invokes a tool for running ProofPower commands which you do not want to have in your script.
(This tool is not available in a stand-alone editor).
.LP
* Edit Menu
.LP
This menu is used for the following editing functions, most of which operate on the X/Motif clipboard (a means of passing fragments of text around between applications or within one application).

.IP "Cut" 10
moves the text you have selected out of your script into the clipboard
.IP "Copy" 10
copies the text you have selected to the clipboard. This doesn't change the script
.IP "Paste" 10

.IP "Clear" 10
deselects any text you have selected. This doesn't change the script.
.IP "Undo/Redo" 10
undoes the last editing operation you carried out.
.LP
* Command Menu
.LP
This menu is used to pass commands to ProofPower.
These commands will prompt you if the effect is likely to lose some of your work.
The command menu is not provided in a stand-alone editor.
.IP "Execute" 16
sends the text you have selected to be executed as a ProofPower command.
.IP "Return" 16
sends a carriage return character.
.IP "Interrupt" 16
sends an interrupt signal.
.IP "Kill" 16
sends a kill signal.
.IP "Restart" 16

.LP
* Search Tool
.LP
This tool is used to search for patterns in the script window.
It also lets you replace some or all occurrences of a pattern
with replacement text and navigate around the text using line numbers.
The tool provides a number of push-buttons and three text areas.
The upper-most text area is where you enter the search pattern.
The other large text area is for any replacement text.
The small text area at the bottom is used to hold a line number.
The push-buttons work as follows:

.IP "<= Search" 16
starts a ``backwards'' search: it looks for the first occurrence of the search pattern before the cursor position in the script window.
If the pattern is found, it will be highlight in the script window
.IP "Search =>" 16
starts a ``forwards'' search: it looks for the first occurrence of the pattern after the cursor position in the script window.
.IP ":= Selection" 16
copies the current selection (if any) from the script window into
the text area immediately below.
.IP "Replace" 16
causes the current selection in the script window to be replaced by
the contents of the replacement text area.
.IP "Replace All" 16
causes all occurrences of the search pattern to be replaced by the replacement
text.
.IP "Goto line" 16
causes the script window to move to the line whose number is in
the line number area.
.IP ":= Cursor" 16
causes the number of the line in the script window containing the cursor
to be placed in the line number area.
.IP "Dismiss" 16
hides the Search Tool from view. You can bring it back by
selecting the `Search & Replace' item in the `Tools' menu again. 
.IP "Help" 16
displays this help text.
.LP
* Command Line Tool
.LP
This tool is used to execute command lines which you do not wish to
save in the script your are editing. The tool comprises three parts:
.IP "1" 4
A scrolled list which is used to remember commands you wish to execute
frequently.
.IP "2" 4
A text area to hold a command line ready for execution.
You can type directly into this text area or you can fetch
one of the items in the list above by double-clicking on the item you want. 
Typing return in this text area causes the command to be executed
(as does the button labelled `Execute'). 
.IP "3" 4
A row of push-buttons.
.LP
The push-buttons work as follows:
.IP "Execute" 16
causes the command in the text area to be executed.
.IP "Add" 16
adds the command in the text area to the end of the list.
.IP "Delete" 16
removes the selected (highlighted) item from the list.
.IP "Dismiss" 16

.LP
* Options Tool
.LP
This tool is used to check or alter various settings
which control the way xpp works.
The tool contains several text areas (in which you type textual or
numeric values) and several toggle switches (small square or lozenge
shaped buttons which you operate using the left mouse button).
Commentary is provieded alongside each text area or toggle switch
to explain its purpose.

The tool also has four push-buttons in a row at the bottom which work
as follows: 
.IP "Apply" 16
brings the settings you have entered into force.
.IP "Reset" 16
puts the settings back to those which applied when `xpp' was first started.
.IP "Dismiss" 16
