In the form with

everything after

is taken as comprising an argument list
.B "arg ..."
for the command.
.B "-f"
may be omitted if
.B "name"
is not itself an xpp option.
.LP
Any other valid options for the program

that is used to run an interactive ProofPower session
may also be supplied as
.I "xpp options."
.LP
If neither
.B "-d database"
or
.B "-c command"
is specified, then
.I "xpp"
will run an editor-only session.
If
.B "-d database"
is specified then
.I "xpp"
will run the shell script
.I "pp(1)"
passing it the relevant
.I "xpp options."
If
.B "-c command"
is specified,
.I "xpp"
will run a command session
with the command line exactly as specified after
.B "-c."
It is an
error for options relating to a ProofPower run to appear before
.B "-c."

The command line interface to
.I "xpp"
is configurable.
The above describes the standard configuration.
See the
.I "xpp"
.I "User Guide"
