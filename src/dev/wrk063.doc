\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Scope}
This document provides an example of a grammar in the {\Slrp} format.
It may be used, {\it inter alia}, for testing the {\Slrp} parser generator.

\subsection{Purpose and Background}
This document is part of the {\Slrp} test suite and also provides an example of
various techniques of interest to users of {\Slrp}.

\subsection{Overview}

This document gives a grammar for ANSI C as per the 1990 standard \cite{ansi90}.
The grammar follows Kernighan \& Ritchie \cite{kernighan88} in leaving out lexical details and
preprocessor syntax.

The grammar is presented so that it can be processed by the {\Slrp} parser generator
to check it for LALR(1) conflicts.
Section~\ref{REFERENCE} of this document gives the grammar, much as in \cite{kernighan88}.
This grammar is given top-down, and is divided into four sections: translation units, declarations,
statements and expressions. The output from processing this section comprises
a {\Slrp} input files: {\tt c.grm.txt}.
The sentence symbols for the grammar is {\it translation\_unit}.

The resulting {\Slrp} grammar for {\it translation\_unit} is essentially an instance of the observations at the beginning
of appendix A13 of~\cite{kernighan88}, which correctly predicts that the results is free
of LALR(1) conflicts apart from the shift/reduce conflict caused by the ``dangling else'' ambiguity
(which is to be resolved by always shifting, which makes the dangling else belong to the innermost
if-statement).

The grammar as presented in section~\ref{REFERENCE} is not suitable for practical use.
This is because it presupposes that the names defined in {\tt typedef} declarations.can be
distinguished lexically, whereas, in fact, that distinction is necessarily context-sensitive.
A companion document, \cite{LEMMA1/DEV/WRK077} gives a {\Slrp} grammar that
can be used to parse the full ANSI-C language, but which is necesarily more complex than the
reference grammar presented here.

The production for {\it typedef\_name} has to be modified, since the grammar becomes ambiguous
if typedef names cannot be distinugished from other names. E.g., to decide whether the
expression ``{\tt(X)(x)}'' is a cast or a function call, one needs to know whether ``{\tt X}''
denotes a type.

This is where the shift/reduce conflict arises. The statement ``{\tt if(a) if(b) f(); else g();}''
can be parsed so that the else-part belongs to the inner if-statement or the outer one
according to the following grammar. The resolution is that it should belong to the
inner if-statement, i.e., reduce.
