\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design of the functional tool-kit, called for by section 4.1.2 of the Release 1 ICL HOL Product Requirement Specification \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF004},
and by the high level design \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD006}.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP001}.

\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document gives a detailed design, in the form of signatures and informal descriptions,  of a number of general purpose
Standard ML objects
which are of use in coding the prototype HOL system.
Many of these are general functions which
support some common functional programming idioms.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
The definitions in this document are self-contained
and depend only on the Standard ML facilities defined
in \cite{Harper86}.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
The treatment of output supports only output
of messages to the terminal (i.e. UNIX standard output),
and this document contains no input functions.
These facilities may need revision.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
Versions of the general functions defined here
may well be supplied with particular
Standard ML compilers. It may improve performance if
the supplied versions are used.
\section{INFIX DIRECTIVES}
A Standard ML $infix$ command must be given at the `top level'.
Thus we give the commands here for those functions declared in the following signatures.
=SML
infix 4 drop;
infix 4 less;
infix 4 grab;
infix 4 cup;
infix 3 mem;
infix 3 subset;
infix 3 ~=;
infix 3 ~<=;
infix 4 diff;
infix 4 overwrite;
infix 4 list_overwrite;
infix 4 roverwrite;
infix 4 list_roverwrite;
infix 5 from;
infix 5 to;
infix 4 **;
infix 4 fun_and;
infix 4 fun_or;
infix 7 idiv imod @*;
infix 6 @+ @-;
infix 4 @< @> @<= @>=;
=TEX
The binding precedences are chosen reflect ``most likely use''.
A higher precedence indicates tighter binding.
Thus we choose higher precedences for functions that construct
objects (e.g. $cup$) rather than test for properties (e.g. $mem$)
so that we test ``the largest constructed objects'' rather than
their constituents.

For comparison Standard ML sets the following precedences:

\begin{tabular}{| c | l |}\hline
Precedence & Functions \\ \hline
7 & $/$, $div$, $mod$, $*$ \\
6 & $+$, $-$, \verb"^" \\
5 & $::$, $@$ \\
4 & $=$, $<>$, $<$, $>$, $<=$, $>=$ \\
3 & $:=$, $o$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

As $::$ is used to construct sets that may be operated on by, e.g., $overwrite$, $overwrite$ has precedence 4, and thus
set equality and set inclusion, $~=$ and $~< =$, have precedence 3.
Prefix function application has higher precedence than all infix functions.
Language keywords (e.g. $andalso$, $orelse$) have a lower precedence than any infix function.

\section{SHARED TYPES IN THIS DOCUMENT}
=DOC
signature ÛUtilitySharedTypesÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
Any new types in the Utility structures mentioned in more than one signature
will be declared in this signature.
=ENDDOC
The associated structure is also declared in this document,
as the types involved are required to declare the signatures
that follow this one.
=DOC
datatype 'a ÛOPTÝ = ÛNilÝ | ÛValueÝ of 'a;
=DESCRIBE
A type of ``optional'' values.
=USES
A typical use for the datatype $'a\;OPT$ is  in implementing
partial functions for which raising an exception
is not an appropriate action for undefined cases.
=SEEALSO
$force\_value$, $is\_Nil$
=ENDDOC
=DOC
type 'a ÛS_DICTÝ;
=DESCRIBE
The type of simple dictionaries: $(string\ *\ 'a)\ list$.
=SEEALSO
Signature $SimpleDictionary$.
=ENDDOC
=SML
end (* UtilitySharedTypes signature *);
=TEX
We now declare the shared type structure:
=SML
structure ÛUtilitySharedTypesÝ : UtilitySharedTypes = struct
	datatype 'a ÛOPTÝ = ÛNilÝ | ÛValueÝ of 'a;
	type 'a ÛS_DICTÝ = (string * 'a) list;
end;
open UtilitySharedTypes;
=TEX
\section{LIST UTILITIES}
=DOC
signature ÛListUtilitiesÝ = sig

\subsection{Functions For Type $'a\ OPT$}
=DOC

=DESCRIBE
Is the argument equal to $Nil$  (q.v).
=GFT Definition
is_Nil Nil = true 
| is_Nil _ = false
=TEX
=ENDDOC
We choose the unconventional capitalisation of $is\_Nil$ to
avoid clashing with the name $is\_nil$ (q.v.).
\subsection{A Miscellany}

lists.
=DOC
val ÛhdÝ : 'a list -> 'a;

\subsection{Lists as Sets}
$drop$,  $less$ and $grab$ are infix operators with priority 4 (lower than
`::' and higher than `=').
$drop$ and $less$ are essentially the set difference operation.
$grab$ is union with a singleton set.

=ENDDOC
=DOC
val ÛunionÝ : ('a * 'a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list;
=SYNOPSIS
A prefix binary union operation for lists, with parameterised equality test.
=DESCRIBE
$union$ is essentially a binary union operation for lists.
Since we need it to work on types which are
not equality types, it has a parameter giving the relation to be
used to determine equality of members of the lists.
In some cases it may be important for the order of members of the union
to be known. The rule is that $union\,eq\,list1\,list2$ is
the list obtained by prepending those elements of $list1$ not already present in $list2$, to the list $list2$.
Presence for $x$ in the list being created being
that there is a
member, $y$, of the list being created with $eq(x,\,y)\,=\,true$.
If $list1$ contains duplicates then all but the rightmost will be eliminated,
but those in $list2$ will not be.
Note also that if one of the lists is small it is better
supplied as the first list argument if efficiency is of
the essence.
=GFT Definition
union eq (list1 @ [a]) list2 = union eq list1 (
	if present eq a list2
	then list2 
	else (a :: list2)

\subsection{Lists of Pairs as Functions and Relations}

\section{DICTIONARIES}
To implement HOL theories and the theory hierarchy
we need to represent the type and constant environments
of the formal specification (\cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC001}).
These environments are essentially partial functions from
$string$ to values of suitable type.

The operations required on these partial functions
are: application,
extension by a singleton function, deletion of elements
from the domain and overwriting both
by singleton functions and by arbitrary partial function.
This is similar to what is typically required for
the symbol table of a compiler.
We will call a data structure together with functions
to perform these operations a ``dictionary''.

We offer two generic implementations of dictionaries
here. The first implementation uses linear search
and performs slowly when the data structures become
large. The second implementation uses a hash addressing technique
and gives considerably more efficient access than the simple
implementation to larger data structures.

\subsection{Simple Dictionaries}
The implementation will use linear search
and performs slowly when the data structures become
large.
 
Its functions are straightforward. We use the prefix $s\_$ to
distinguish the types and functions involved from those
used for the more efficient technique.

After defining a simple dictionary to be a list of
pairs, the functions for accessing and modifying
dictionaries are essentially just interfaces to the
partial function operations defined in
signature $ListUtilities$.

The type of simple dictionaries is declared in signature $UtilitySharedTypes$.

\subsection{Efficient Dictionaries}
The technique we use for the more efficient dictionaries
is essentially the standard compiler writer's technique
of hash addressing with chaining to handle collisions
(see, for example, \cite{Bornat79}).

We discuss the detailed algorithm in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP001}.
The signature is essentially that of simple dictionaries, 
only the desire to open these structures at the same time,
and a few additional functions,
means that the signatures are not unified.

Its functions are similar to those of $SimpleDictionary$.

has not been called in the current session.

The following points should be born in mind when using these functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The times are ``wall-clock'' times. Garbage-collection and other overheads
will be included.
\item
Depending on the underlying Standard ML compiler, arithmetic overflow may occur if the units
are chosen inappropriately for the time period being measured.
\item
The functions will themselves introduce a time overhead, which may vary depending on
system load and other system-dependent factors.
\end{itemize}

\section{SORTING}
=DOC
signature ÛSortÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
This provides an efficient sort utility package.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val ÛsortÝ : ('a -> 'a -> int) -> 'a list -> 'a list
=SYNOPSIS
A parameterised sort of a list.
=DESCRIBE
The sorting of items of type $'a$ is parameterised by an
ordering function of type $'a -> 'a -> int$.
The integer, say $n$ returned by an application
of this function, say $f\ a_1\ a_2$, is interpreted as
follows: 
\begin{description}
\item[$n < 0$] $a_2$ is to come after $a_1$ (i.e. the arguments are in order).
\item[$n > 0$] $a_2$ is to come before $a_1$ (i.e. the arguments are out of order).
\item[$n = 0$] $a_2$ is to be taken as equal to $a_1$
(all but the first of each set of duplicates, in this sense, will be ignored).
\end{description}
=EXAMPLE
To sort a list of integers, ilist in ascending order:

	sort (curry (op -)) ilist
=SEEALSO
For two possible orderings: $string\_order$ and $lexicographic$.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûstring_orderÝ : string -> string -> int
=DESCRIBE
This function gives a more civilised ordering on
strings than the one given by the ASCII codes.
It first does a lexicographic (q.v) case-insensitive ordering
(treating all upper case letters as their corresponding lower case), all alphabetic characters are considered ``before'' the rest,
but otherwise using ASCII order, on exploded strings.
If two strings are otherwise equal then a case-sensitive
comparison is made, with the string having the first unmatched capitalisation being ordered as first.
The integer result is appropriate for use in $sort$ (q.v.).
=SEEALSO
$lexicographic$
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val ÛlexicographicÝ : ('a -> 'a -> int) -> 'a list -> 'a list -> int
=SYNOPSIS
This function returns the lexicographic ordering
function induced from an ordering
of items of type $'a$ on items of type $'a\,list$.
=DESCRIBE
Lexicographic ordering may be defined as follows:

Let us presume some ordering $<$ on the type of variables $a_i$ and $b_i$.
Then
\[ [a_1, \ldots, a_n]\ <_{lexicographic}\ [b_1, \ldots, b_m] \]
If, and only if, either
\[ n\ <_{int}\ m\ ± \ µ i : 1 .. n\ ·\ a_i\ =\ b_i\]
Or
\[¶ j : 1 .. n\ ·\ (µ i : 1 .. (j-1)\ ·\ a_i\ =\ b_i)\ ±\ (a_j\ <\ b_j)\]
The integer result is appropriate for use in $sort$ (q.v.).

\section{SPARSE ARRAYS}
=DOC
signature ÛSparseArrayÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
This is the signature of a structure implementing sparse arrays
(i.e. imperative data structures representing finite partial functions
on the integers).
The sparse arrays also give an efficient means for handling dense (i.e.
contiguous) arrays whose size varies. To facilitate their use for such
dynamically sized arrays, the sparse arrays have lower and
upper bound attributes
which gives the smallest and
largest indices into the array which identify an occupied cell.

The design of the structure is an adaptation of the library
structure $Array$ implementing fixed length arrays.
=ENDDOC
=DOC

=DESCRIBE
This is the type of a sparse array with entries of type $'\_a$.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
	val ÛarrayÝ 		: int -> '_a SPARSE_ARRAY;
=DESCRIBE
This function creates an empty sparse array. The parameter indicates the
length of an internal data structure used to represent the array.
For a contiguous array or for a sparsely filled array with
a random distribution of occupied cells, the average access time for an
element will be proportional to $n/l$ where $n$ is the number of occupied cells
and $l$ is this length.

been occupied (indeed, $update$ is the only means by which cells become
occupied).

it returns $Nil$.

	val ÛlindexÝ		:  '_a SPARSE_ARRAY -> int
	val ÛuindexÝ		: '_a SPARSE_ARRAY -> int

$lbound(array)$ (resp. $ubound(array)$) returns the smallest (resp. largest)
index of an occupied cell in the sparse array $array$.
An exception is raised if the array is empty.

\section{DYNAMIC ARRAYS}

signature ÛDynamicArrayÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
This is the signature of a structure implementing dynamic arrays
with 0-based indexing (i.e. imperative data structures representing
finite partial functions on the integers, whose range is an interval $1 \ldots n$).
The implementation gives constant access time.
The design of the structure is an adaptation of the library
structure $Array$ implementing fixed length arrays.

This is the type of a dynamic array with entries of type $'\_a$.

=DESCRIBE
This function creates an empty dynamic array. The parameter indicates the
length of an internal data structure used to represent the initial size of the array.
The average access time for an element will be constant --- the underlying
array structure is grown as necessary.

\section{ARBITRARY MAGNITUDE INTEGER ARITHMETIC}
Some compilers provide arbitrary magnitude integer arithmetic as standard.
Others provide arithmetic that can overflow. For efficient and general
reasoning about integers, we require arbitrary magnitude arithmetic.
This section provides a portable interface to this.
It is provided here rather than in the portability module~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD109} because we want to use the {\Product} approach to error handling (see~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD002}).

=DESCRIBE
This is the signature of an open structure providing arithmetic on integers
of arbitrary magnitude. It is used to support HOL natural numbers and
other object language numeric types. The names of the usual arithmetic
operators are decorated with an initial $i$ or $@$ as appropriate.
The string conversions work with signed decimal string representations.
Either `%
=INLINEFT

=TEX
' or `%
=INLINEFT
~
=TEX
' may be used for unary negation and a leading `%
+
=TEX
' is also allowed.
$@@$ is an abbreviation for $integer\_of\_string$.
$natural\_of\_string$ is a converter for non-negative numbers (it has
the same error cases as $nat\_of\_string$).

$string\_of\_float$ interprets a triple $(x, p, e)$ as a floating point number with value $x \times 10^{e - p}$ and converts the triple into its string representation.

\section{TEST POLICY}
In  \cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008} there is a statement of the general principle of testing to be adopted.
This section gives some individual comments on special testing requirements for individual functions.

Any function parameterised by an equality argument should be tested with an asymmetric ``equality'', to check the argument order.

The design of the function $union$ describes a particular ordering of its result.
The conformance to this order should be checked.

The functions $lassoc{\cal N}$, $rassoc{\cal N}$ and all others that act on ``\ldots the first element of the list that \ldots'' should be checked with lists containing duplicates, to ensure that the first matching element is selected.

The designs of functions $string\_order$ and $lexicographic$
describe orderings that their implementations should be tested against.
