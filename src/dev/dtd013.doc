\section{GENERAL}

\subsection{Scope}

This documents the detailed design of the
module test harness. The harness is to be
used for the purpose of developing
and running tests for the ICL HOL development.
The document has been produced in response to the
requirements stated in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008}.

\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Background and Purpose}

The test harness allows a function to be tested by
supplying the harness with the function, some
inputs and expected
outputs. It can test functions for handling exceptions, and
check that the message generated by an exception corresponds
to one expected.

The harness should make the development of module tests
much easier and in particular, help the developer
speedily identify those test cases which fail.

\subsubsection{Interface}

This document defines a signature $ModuleTest$.

\subsubsection{Deficiencies}

None Known.

\subsubsection{Dependencies}

This document depends on the error handling system described
in document \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD002}.


\section{THE STRUCTURE $ModuleTest$}

=DOC
signature âModuleTestá = sig
=DESCRIBE
This is the signature for the structure $ModuleTest$.
=ENDDOC

The module test harness comprises functions to do the
following:

\begin{description}

\item[Test Execution Functions]
These functions generally take test data and produce
a list of test results. The results can be delivered to
the control functions for managing the test results.

\item[Control Functions]
The test execution functions manage the running
of the module tests. These allow test results
to be collected together and printed at the
end of running the tests. 

\end{description}

\subsection{The function $gen\_fail\_msg$}
The function $gen\_fail\_msg$ will be
useful for generating fail and error exception messages for
constructing test data.

=DOC
	val âgen_fail_msgá : string -> int -> string list -> string;
=DESCRIBE
{\it gen\_fail\_msg} allows the user to construct an error
message of the form that would be generated by the system
on the occasion of a ``Fail'' or an ``Error'' exception.
This is provided to aid the developer of test material to
generate test data.

The function takes three arguments. The
first argument supplied indicates the name of the
function from which the message would have been generated.
The second identifies the error message in the error
message database. The third is a list of strings which
may be used to substitute strings in the error message string.
=EXAMPLE
	icl'change_error_message{id=1,text="Error message"};
	gen_fail_msg "mt" 1 [];
=SEEALSO
{\it fail} and {\it error} described in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD002}.
=ENDDOC

\subsection{Test Execution Functions}

=DOC
	val âmt_runá		: (string * ('a -> ''b) * 'a * ''b) list -> (string * bool) list;
=DESCRIBE
{\it mt\_run} is a function which takes a list of test cases
and delivers a list of results. The test cases are
of the form $(testcase, function, argument, expected-result)$

$testcase$ is a string which identifies the test. 
$function$ is the function to be tested. $argument$ is the
input which is supplied to the function to produce an output.
If the output matches $expected-result$ then $(testcase,\ true)$
is produced for that particular test, otherwise
$(testcase,\ false)$ is produced. 
=USES
{\it mt\_run} can be used alone as in the example below for debugging
test cases. When running the module tests formally however, it should
be used in conjunction with {\it store\_mt\_results} and
{\it store\_mt\_results\_show}.
=EXAMPLE
	mt_run [("TESTCASE",hd, [3,4,5], 3)];
=SEEALSO
{\it mt\_runf}, {\it store\_mt\_results}, {\it store\_mt\_results\_show}
=ENDDOC

=DOC
	val âmt_runfá		: (('b * 'c) -> bool) -> ((string * ('a -> 'b) * 'a * 'c) list)
					-> (string * bool) list;
=DESCRIBE
{\it mt\_runf} is a function which takes a comparison
function, a list of test cases
and delivers a list of results. The test cases are
of the form $(testcase, function, argument, expected-result)$.
$testcase$ is a string which identifies the test.
$function$ is the function to be tested. $argument$ is the
input which is supplied to the function to produce an output.
If the comparison function provided returns the value
true when given the result of the function applied to the
argument, and $expected-result$, then $(testcase,\ true)$
is produced for that particular test, otherwise
$(testcase,\ false)$ is produced.
=USES
{\it mt\_runf} can be used when it is inappropriate to
check that the result of a function is equal to some expected
result. For example a ``greater-than'' function could
be supplied for testing that an evaluation of a function with
an input is always greater than a particular value.
Another use would be to supply a comparison function for
comparing objects of two different types. An example of this
use is shown below.

{\it mt\_runf} can be used alone as in the example below for debugging
test cases. When running the module tests formally however, it should
be used in conjunction with {\it store\_mt\_results} and
{\it store\_mt\_results\_show}.
=EXAMPLE
	datatype VAL = Value of int;
	fun is_eq (i, Value n) = (i = n);
	mt_runf is_eq [("TESTCASE",hd, [3,4,5], Value 3)];
=SEEALSO
{\it mt\_run}, {\it store\_mt\_results}, {\it store\_mt\_results\_show}
=ENDDOC

=DOC
	val âmt_run_failá	: ((string * ('a -> 'b) * 'a * string) list) -> (string * bool) list;
	val âmt_run_errorá	: ((string * ('a -> 'b) * 'a * string) list) -> (string * bool) list;
=DESCRIBE
{\it mt\_run\_fail} is a function which takes a list of
test cases and yields a list of test results. Each test
case is expected to raise an exception with the
constructor``Fail''.
{\it mt\_run\_fail} will catch the exception and compare the error message
generated with the expected message supplied in each test
case. If the messages match, then the test result is of
the form $(testcase,\ true)$, otherwise it is of the form
$(testcase,\ false)$.

{\it mt\_run\_error} is the same as {\it mt\_run\_fail} in
all respects, except that an
exception with the constructor ``Error'' is expected
to be raised for each test case.

=USES
{\it mt\_run\_fail} and {\it mt\_run\_error}
can be used as in the example below for debugging
test cases. When running the module tests however, they should
only be used in conjunction with {\it store\_mt\_results} and
{\it store\_mt\_results\_show}.
=EXAMPLE
	icl'change_error_message{id=1,text="Error message"};
	val exp_res = gen_fail_msg "mt" 1 [];
	mt_run_fail [("TESTCASE", fail "mt" 1, [], exp_res)];
	mt_run_error [("TESTCASE", error "mt" 1, [], exp_res)];
=SEEALSO
{\it store\_mt\_results}, {\it store\_mt\_results\_show}
=ENDDOC

\subsection{Control Functions}

=DOC
	val âinit_mt_resultsá		: unit -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
{\it init\_mt\_results} initialises the store of computed
results to an empty list. This is the state the store
should be set to before running any tests.
=USES
It should be called before any tests are run. It can
also be used to re-initialise the result store at any time.
=EXAMPLE
	init_mt_results();
=ENDDOC

=DOC
	val âstore_mt_resultsá		: ('a -> (string * bool) list) -> 'a -> unit;
	val âstore_mt_results_showá	: ('a -> (string * bool) list) -> 'a -> (string * bool) list;
=DESCRIBE
These functions take two arguments. The first is a function
which takes a list of test cases and produces a
list of outputs.  The second argument is a list of test cases
which are to be tested.  Both functions apply the first
argument to the second to obtain the results of running the tests.
The function $store\_mt\_results\_show$ appends these results to the
result store, it then returns them --- the test cases are evaluated once.
The function $store\_mt\_results$ appends the results to the
result store, it returns a value of type $unit$.

=USES
These two functions can be used to build up a set of test
case results, which can be printed later using {\it get\_mt\_results}. 
=EXAMPLE
	store_mt_results mt_run [("TESTCASE",hd, [3,4,5], 3)];
	store_mt_results_show mt_run [("TESTCASE",hd, [3,4,5], 3)];
=ENDDOC

=DOC
	val âget_mt_resultsá		: unit -> (string * bool) list;
=DESCRIBE
{\it get\_mt\_results} prints the contents of the results
store. This prints a list of ordered pairs. The first
element of a pair in the list is a string which identifies the
test case which has been tested. The second element of the pair
is the value $true$ or $false$ indicating success or failure
of the test. The list of results will only contain those
tests which have actually been run. Thus, the list is
a complete record of all tests which have been run.
=USES
It is typically used after running several module
tests, and will print a complete set of results since
the beginning of the run, or since the last call to
{\it init\_mt\_results}.
=EXAMPLE
	get_mt_results();
=ENDDOC

=DOC
	val âsummarize_mt_resultsá	: unit -> string;
=DESCRIBE
{\it summarize\_mt\_results} returns $true$ if and only if
all the tests in the results store have passed. Otherwise
it returns $false$. It is thus the result of ``and-ing'' the
second element of each pair in the list of results obtained.
=USES
It enables a user to establish quickly if there are any failed
tests. This is useful when dealing with large sets of results.
=EXAMPLE
	summarize_mt_results();
=ENDDOC


=SML

\section{GUIDE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF TEST CASES}

The following is a suggested structure for constructing tests
using the test harness. By enclosing the variable declarations
in the let clause, unnecessary output is minimised.
There are two tests in the example below. The test
cases are the strings ``func.1'' and ``func.2''. They
test that the function $func$ supplied with arguments $i1$ and
$i2$ deliver $r1$ and $r2$ respectively. The tests are evaluated
by the function $mt\_run$, and are stored in a results store
using $store\_mt\_results$.

=EXAMPLE
let	val i1 = ...;
	val i2 = ...;

	val r1 = ...;
	val r2 = ...;
in

store_mt_results mt_run [
	("func.1", func, i1, r1),
	("func.2", func, i2, r2)
]
end;
=TEX

The next example is given to show how tests might be constructed
for checking that ``fail'' exceptions occur when they are
supposed to. It differs from the above example in that
the expected results are generated using the function
$gen\_fail\_message$.

The test
cases are the strings ``func.3'' and ``func.4''. They
test that the function $func$ supplied with arguments $i3$ and
$i4$ fail with the messages $fm1$ and $fm2$ respectively.
The function $mt\_run\_fail$ runs
the tests, expecting an exception with the constructor, ``Fail''
to be raised. The results are subsequently stored using $store\_mt\_results$.

=EXAMPLE
let	val i3 = ...;
	val i4 = ...;

	val fm1 = gen_fail_message ...;
	val fm2 = gen_fail_message ...;
in

store_mt_results mt_run_fail [
	("func.3", func, i3, fm1),
	("func.4", func, i4, fm2)
]
end;

summarize_mt_results();
=TEX

At the end of the tests the results are summarized by the
call to the function $summarize\_mt\_results$. Note that
a spurious call to $init\_mt\_results$ will clear the results
store, and results collected up to that point will be lost.


\section{TEST POLICY}
The tests should follow the standards and guidelines laid down in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008}.
