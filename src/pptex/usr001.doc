\section{GENERAL}

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Scope}

This document gives user oriented description of a text formatting
facility which allows the use of \LaTeX\ to prepare documents
containing Z, HOL and similar formal material.  The facilities are
similar in spirit to those described in \cite{DS/FMU/infra/006}, for
preparing such documents using {\tt ptroff}, but offer several
additional features.

This document describes the version of the system which works with
\TeX\ version~3.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Introduction}

Some utility programs and supporting files have been produced to assist
in the handling of literate scripts, \ie, files containing a mixture of
formal material (\eg, HOL, Standard~ML code, or Z) and narrative text.
The utilities support the extraction of formal material for processing
(\eg, by the Standard~ML compiler) or for typesetting.  The typesetting
aspects are oriented towards \LaTeX, but some are suitable for use with
other typesetting systems, such as {\tt ptroff.}

For typesetting the package contains of a \LaTeX\ style file (\ie, a
macro suite) named {\tt hol.sty}; a preprocessor program, {\tt
doc2tex}; and a font {\tt newzfont.}  There are two shell scripts {\tt
doc4tex} and {\tt tex4dvi} which are the recommended means of calling
{\tt doc2tex} and running \LaTeX\ in normal use.

The preprocessor allows the user to prepare a \LaTeX\
file using the extended character set described in
\cite{DS/FMU/infra/006}, this character set is often
called the ``pretty character set.''  With this character
set the formal material appears on the screen much
as it does in the printed document, while the format of
the file is compatible with the HOL system, {\it via}
the interfaces described in \cite{DS/FMU/infra/006}.

This document describes the typesetting facilities, largely by
example.  We assume some familiarity with \LaTeX, which is described in
\cite{lamport86} and with the HOL infrastructure for supporting Z-like
constructs described in~\cite{DS/FMU/infra/002}.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Note On Compatibility}

Literate scripts which contain formal text for processing with
the Cambridge HOL system may be typeset with \LaTeX\ using
{\tt doc4tex} and {\tt tex4dvi}, provided the pretty characters
`\Sh{\Startinfixaxdes}', `$\lceil$', `$\lfloor$',
`\Sh{\Topleft}', `\Sh{\Topright}', `\Sh{\Bottomleft}' and
`\Sh{\Bigturnstile}' \etc,
are used to delimit the formal material rather than troff macros.
The facilities described in \cite{DS/FMU/infra/006} may be used to
extract the formal material for processing by Cambridge HOL.
Theory listings may be included in literate scripts provided they
are first processed with {\tt doc2tex} using the {\tt -i} option.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{FILE FORMATS}

Various files are read or written by the programs in the package.
Three letter suffixes are used in file names to distinguish the various
file formats involved.  These are described in table
\ref{FileSuffixes}.  Note that the master format for a literate script
is the {\tt .doc} format; the other formats are derived from this by
running programs which, in general, lose some information.

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{||l|p{5.5in}||} \hline
Suffix & Description \\ \hline \hline
{\tt .doc} & This is the usual format in which literate scripts
are held under SCCS control and in which they are edited.\\ \hline
{\tt .dvi} & This is the {\tt tex4dvi} output file (more precisely, it
is the \TeX\ or \LaTeX\ output file) which may be viewed with a screen
previewer, or printed.  \\ \hline
{\tt .idx} & This contains the raw index entries generated by running
\LaTeX\ on a file containing the command \verb"\makeindex". \\ \hline
{\tt .sid} & This is a sorted index file generated by {\tt tex4dvi}.
It is read by the \verb"\printindex" command described
in section~\ref{MakingAnIndex}. \\ \hline
{\tt .tex} & This is a \LaTeX\ input file. It is created
from a {\tt .doc} file using the utilities {\tt screen}
and {\tt doc2tex}. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\caption{File Suffixes} \label{FileSuffixes}

\end{table}

There are several other file suffices that are used by \TeX\ and
\LaTeX\  for various purposes.  They are derived from the {\tt .tex}
file and are documented in the \TeX\ and \LaTeX\ books,~\cite{knuth84}
and~\cite{lamport86}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{USING THE PACKAGE}
\label{UsingThePackage}

The programs of the package are located in a directory which should be
placed on the shell search path.  This directory also contains some of
the supporting files.  In our configuration the programs are held in
the directory {\tt /hat/loc/bin} which is set to access the correct
files on both Sun~3 and Sun~4 architectures.  The \LaTeX\ macro files
{\tt hol.sty} and {\tt TQ.sty} are contained in a second directory.
These style files should be made available to \TeX\ and \LaTeX\ by
setting the {\tt TEXINPUTS} environment variable.  This may be done by
including a line based on the following in the C-shell startup file
(\verb"~/.cshrc").

\begin{quote}
{\tt setenv TEXINPUTS .:{\em local-macros\/}:{\em main-macros\/}:}
\end{quote}

Where, {\em local-macros\/} is replaced with the directory containing
{\tt hol.sty} and {\tt TQ.sty}, and {\em main-macros\/} with the
directory holding the standard \TeX\ and \LaTeX\ macro files.  In our
configuration these directories are {\tt /hat/loc/tex/macros} and {\tt
/hat/nih/tex3/inputs} respectively.

Here, the environment variable {\tt TEXINPUTS} contains a colon
separated list of three directories which \TeX\ and \LaTeX\ scan from
the left for any source files they want to read.  Thus, files are
chosen from the current directory (\ie, the ``.'' entry) in preference
to the other directories.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{FORMATTING DOCUMENTS}

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Getting Started}

To use the package you prepare a file, say {\tt myfile.doc}, using an
editor which supports an appropriate pretty font. The font {\tt
newzfont} is recommended.

The form of the file is essentially that of a
\LaTeX\ file except that you can use pretty
(\ie, non-ASCII) characters to type Z or HOL constructs.
A list of most of these characters is given in
section~\ref{ListOfPrettyCharacters} below.  The remaining pretty
characters are used for bracketing formal text for printing and other
processing, these characters are discussed elsewhere in this document.

The first \LaTeX\ command in the document (normally this is the
\verb"\documentstyle" command) should be preceded with a line
containing just the characters ``\verb"=TEX"''.  Any lines before this
are simply ignored.  The significance of this line will be made clear
in section~\ref{AboutScreen} where the {\tt screen} program and
the {\tt screenfile} are discussed.  For the moment, be aware that
any line whose first character is an equals sign ``{\tt=}'' indicates
the type of processing for the lines that follow.

The \verb"\documentstyle" command line that you use should include the
option {\tt hol}. \eg, this document starts with:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
	=TEX
\documentstyle[TQ,hol,11pt]{article}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

to get the options {\tt TQ} (which gives our house style which is used
at an eleven point size) and {\tt hol}.

To process the file and produce a {\tt .dvi} file
you run the preprocessor then run \LaTeX\ as follows:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
doc4tex myfile
tex4dvi myfile
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

The above recipe assumes that you have put the directory containing the
programs on your search path --- all subsequent mentions of programs
will assume that the search path is set up correctly.  If your
document does not include a request to make an index as described in
\ref{MakingAnIndex} below, {\tt tex4dvi} will report on the fact that
the file {\tt myfile.idx} does not exist or cannot be read. This
message may be ignored if you do not wish your document to have an
index.  

The basic job of the preprocessor, {\tt doc2tex} is to translate each
non-ASCII character into \LaTeX\ macro calls which
typeset that character. Some non-ASCII characters
control the way in which it does this,
as we shall see.

Because of the way \LaTeX\ works when producing the self-referential
aspects of a document (\eg, table of contents, page and section
references, \etc) the program {\tt tex4dvi} will need to be run up to
four times.  If bibliographies use \BibTeX{} then the program {\tt
bibtex} should be run between the first and second execution of {\tt
tex4dvi}.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{\LaTeX\ Environments}

Several \LaTeX\ environments are provided by the {\tt hol} style, they
are not normally invoked by typing the \verb"\begin{...}" and
\verb"\end{...}" commands of other \LaTeX\ environments.
Table~\ref{LaTeXEnvironments} list the environments available in the
{\tt hol} style.  Each environment corresponds to a Z or HOL box, or
some other piece of formal text.  To use the environments you use the
`opening' and `closing bracket' characters listed in the
table~\ref{LaTeXEnvironments}.  An exception to this is discussed in
section~\ref{TheoryListings} below.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\def\arraystretch{1.5}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|p{3in}|} \hline
Environment & Opening & Closing & Purpose \\ 
            & Bracket & Bracket & \\ \hline \hline
{\tt zschema}*& \Sh{\TopleftZ} & \Sh{\Bottomleft} &
Z schema definition \\
{\tt zgenconst}& \Sh{\Digamma} & \Sh{\Bottomleft} &
Z generic constant definition\\
{\tt zaxdes}& \Sh{\StartZaxdes} & \Sh{$\lfloor$} &
Z axiomatic description\\
{\tt zother}& \Sh{\StartZother} & \Sh{$\EndML$} &
Other Z paragraph forms: given type \etc \\
{\tt HOLaxdes}& \Sh{$\lceil$} & \Sh{$\lfloor$} &

{\tt HOLinfixaxdes}& \Sh{\Startinfixaxdes} & \Sh{$\lfloor$} &
HOL infix constant definition \\
{\tt HOLschema}*& \Sh{\Topleft} & \Sh{\Bottomleft} &
HOL schema definition \\
{\tt ML}& \Sh{\StartML} & \Sh{\EndML} &
ML code, \eg, a proof. \\
{\tt FT}*& \Sh{\StartFT} & \Sh{\EndML} &
Any other formal text to be typeset in a similar style to
Z or HOL (\eg, HOL output)\\
{\tt FRule}&=RULE&=TEX&Rules \\
{\tt FRule}&=CONVERSION&=TEX&HOL conversions \\
{\tt FRule}&=TACTIC&=TEX&HOL tactics \\
{\tt FRule}&=THEOREM&=TEX&Theorems \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{\LaTeX\ Environments} \label{LaTeXEnvironments}
\end{table}

The environments marked with an asterisk (*) take
a parameter giving the name of the schema, the
parameters of the generic constant or the title
for the formal text.
These should be typed immediately after the `\Sh{\Topleft}'
character followed by optional padding (see below).
(Programs such as {\tt doc2sml, doc4sml} and
{\tt prettyhol} which process such
material may enforce extra rules. \Eg, the HOL
schema header must be terminated by a `\Sh{\Topright}'
character.)  The parameter to the {\tt FT} environment
is optional, its value, if present, is used to label
the printed output.

The {\tt FRule} has no pretty characters to introduce it, instead the
text given in the `Opening Bracket' column of
table~\ref{LaTeXEnvironments} should be written on a line on its own,
similarly for the `Closing Bracket' text.  Section~\ref{AboutFRules}
describes the {\tt FRule} environment in detail.

The shape of the bracketing characters has been chosen
so that you can use them, together with the pretty
characters `\Sh{\Vbar}', `\Sh{\Hbar}', `\Sh{\Bottomright}',
`\Sh{\Topright}', `\Sh{\ParallelLines}' and `\Sh{\Bigturnstile}',
to draw boxes which look on the screen like
the printed form.
The characters `\Sh{\Vbar}', `\Sh{\Hbar}', `\Sh{\Bottomright}',
`\Sh{\Topright}' and `\Sh{\ParallelLines}' are
merely padding and have no effect on the form of
the printed document, although other programs such as
{\tt prettyhol} may use them.  Within one of the three
sorts of HOL box, `\Sh{\Bigturnstile}' causes the bar between the
signature and predicate parts of
the box to be printed. Only padding characters should
appear in the line after the `\Sh{\Bigturnstile}'.
(`\Sh{\Bigturnstile}' corresponds to a \LaTeX\ macro \verb"\crossbar".)

\label{LinesOfInput}
Within any of the above environments, text is typeset
with each ``line of input'' corresponding to a line in the
printed document.
Here if one of the bracketing character pairs listed
above encloses the text then the phrase ``line of input'' actually means
line of input; if you are
using \verb"\begin{...}" and \verb"\end{...}"
to delimit the environments, then  a ``line of input''
must have its beginning and end marked with
\verb"\+" and \verb"\\" respectively.

Tab and space characters may be used to control the layout within each
line of input.  All space characters give a small amount of space in
the printed output.  Tab characters are used to give type-writer style
tabbing, see section~\ref{AboutTabs} for more details.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Quirks and Foibles}

The package is designed
on the assumption that text bracketed
with one of the
pretty character pairs listed above is actually
going to be processed by a program such
as {\tt prettyhol} {\it via\/} 
interfaces like those
described in \cite{DS/FMU/infra/006}.
Consequently, it is assumed ({\it a\/}) that such text will
not contain any \LaTeX\ formatting controls apart from
spaces, tabs and newlines and ({\it b\/}) that any \LaTeX\
special characters such as `\verb|\|', `\verb|$|' and `\verb|_|' are not
to be treated specially and are just to be printed.

The package has also been designed on the assumption
that if you use the \LaTeX\ \verb"\begin{...}" command
to invoke one of the above environments you are
doing it to use \LaTeX\ to get some special effect\footnote{If
you want to do this you will need to know that lines
of text in these environments are typeset in math mode,
adjusted so that all spacing (even around relation
symbols \etc) must be requested explicitly.
See the style file for details of how this is done.}
(see \ref{TheoryListings} below for an exception to this).
The package
therefore only serves to translate non-ASCII characters
in text which is not enclosed in a pair of
bracketing characters.
It does not put in controls
for extra spaces or for printing \LaTeX\ special characters,
on the assumption that you will want to set the
spacing yourself and to use the special characters
as special characters.

Pretty characters may be used in the \LaTeX\ sectioning commands, but
they should not be used in maths mode, \ie, do not enclose them in
dollar `\verb|$|' signs.  The sectioning commands are the commands that
create entries for the table of contents, such as \verb|\section|,
\verb|\subsection| and\verb|\subsubsection|.  Having the pretty
characters in maths mode will often cause \LaTeX\ error messages to be
issued when it reads the `{\tt.toc}' file to generate the table of
contents.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Making an Index of Defined Terms}\label{MakingAnIndex}

An additional pair of pretty characters, `\Startindex' and
`\Endindex' may be used to help make an index of defined terms for the
document.
If you type, say, `\Startindex\verb"InterestingThing"\Endindex',
somewhere in {\tt myfile.doc} then
‚InterestingThing·
will be printed in bold and the \LaTeX\ macro
\verb"\index" will be  called with `InterestingThing'
as parameter.
If, following the instructions in \cite{lamport86},
you have used \verb"\makeindex" earlier in your
document this will cause an entry of the form:

\begin{quote}
\verb"\indexentry{InterestingThing}{"{\tt \thepage}\verb"}"
\end{quote}

to be written in the file {\tt myfile.idx}.  The program {\tt tex4dvi} then
sorts this file and puts the output in {\tt myfile.sid}.

A macro \verb"\printindex" is supplied in the {\tt hol}
style option for
including the index in the printed document.
To use it type \verb"\printindex" in your
file where you want the index to appear.
It reads the file {\tt myfile.sid} in an environment in which
each \verb"\indexentry" produces entries whose form
may be seen in the index to this document.
Long indexes are best printed in two columns by preceding
the \verb"\printindex" call by a call of \verb"\twocolumn",
and smaller characters than usual might be used.  The index
for a document might be included by using the following
\LaTeX\ commands:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\twocolumn[\section{INDEX}]
\footnotesize
\printindex
\onecolumn
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Note that calls of \verb"\twocolumn" and \verb"\twocolumn" will
force page breaks.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Pretty Characters}

All of the pretty characters shown in the pretty characters display
of section~\ref{ListOfPrettyCharacters} may be used in names to be
indexed, they may be the whole name.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Restrictions}

The characters `\Startindex' and `\Endindex' and the processing that is
applied to the \LaTeX\ indexing system are intended for the names of
defined terms and symbols in the formal text.  Using it for the general
purpose indexing of other text, or for text containing tabs or spaces
is not supported.

This document includes two types of indexed entries.  First, many of
the examples of formal text define some name, and these are indexed
using the `\Startindex' and `\Endindex' characters.  Second, the names
of various programs described as part of the text formatting package
are indexed, for example, the program {\tt doc4tex} is described in a
section starting:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\subsection{{\tt doc4tex}\index{doc4tex}}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

If an index-like feature for general text is required then the use of
the \LaTeX\ glossary system, see~\cite{lamport86}, is suggested.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Theory Listings} \label{TheoryListings}

To help you incorporate HOL theory listings and the
like, {\tt doc2tex} has a special way of working.
If the pretty form of the theory listing is held
in the file {\tt theory.lst}, you would use the
command:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
doc2tex -i < theory.lst > theory.inc
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

which makes the file {\tt theory.inc} suitably
for including within an {\tt FT} environment
using the \LaTeX\ command \verb"\input".
You would use something like:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
{
\ftlinepenalty=0
\begin{FT}{Theory Listing}
\input{theory.inc}
\end{FT}
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

to include the listing in your document. Note that
you do not use `\StartFT' and `\EndML' to delimit
the environment here. Note also the adjustment
of \verb"\ftlinepenalty" to allow the listing
to spread over several pages, see section~\ref{AboutFtLinePenalty}.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{HOL Examples} \label{HOLExamples}

Here is an HOL schema:

«`‚STATE·``S`ﬂ
›	high : Ü, low : Ü
…
›	high à low
 ‡

\parbox[t]{0.4\textwidth}{I typed the above approximately
as\\follows:}\kern0.1\textwidth
{\tt
\def\H{\Sh{\Hbar}}
\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
\Sh{\Topleft}`\Startindex STATE\Endindex` `S` \H\H\H\H\Sh{\Topright}\\
\Sh{\Vbar}\hskip 0.5in high : Ü, low : Ü\\
\Sh{\Bigturnstile}\H\H\H\H\\
\Sh{\Vbar}\hskip 0.5in high à low\\
\Sh{\Bottomleft}\H\H\H\H\H\H\H\H\H\H\H\H\H\H\H\H\H\Sh{\Bottomright}\\
\end{tabular}}

An example of the ML environment follows.
Note the font change for the HOL term. 

Â
›	new_theory`12`;;
›	new_parent`pf`;;
›	loadf`infra`;;
›	let  tm="án:Üé1 < n  Ä  n < 10";;
Ê

Terms may of course spread over many lines, as in:
Â
set_goal([],"É(in_f : INPUT_FILTER_TYPE)
		(out_m : OUTPUT_MERGER_TYPE)
		(prog : USER_PROGRAM_TYPE)é
		in_f  ù  input_filter_specification
	Ä	out_m  ù  output_merger_specification
	Ä	progùuser_program_specification
	ä	composite_construction(in_f,out_m,prog)
			ù  secure");;
Ê


The two sorts of constant definition:

»
›	‚secure· : SYSTEM_TYPEãbool
…
›	É(f:SYSTEM_TYPE)é
›	f  ù  secure Ç 
›	És∞ s¨:STATEé(s∞.S_low = s¨.S_low)  ä  ((f s∞).S_low = (f s¨).S_low )
À

Á
›	‚ƒ· : bool ã bool ã bool
…
›	A ƒ B  =  A Ä åB
À

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Z Examples}

We give an example of each sort of Z paragraph
(using the terminology of Spivey's~Z book~\cite{spivey89}).
We start with a given type definition.

Ë
›	[‚NAME·, ‚DATE·]
Ê

\parbox[t]{0.4\textwidth}{I typed the above
approximately like this:}\kern0.1\textwidth
{\tt
\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
\StartZother\\
\Sh{\Vbar}\hskip 0.5in[\Startindex NAME \Endindex,
\Startindex DATE \Endindex]\\
\EndML\\
\end{tabular}}

Now an axiomatic description box:

Í
	‚known·:ëNAME
	‚birthday·:NAMEñDATE
…
	known  =  dom birthday
À

\parbox[t]{0.4\textwidth}{Since `\Sh{\Vbar}'
characters can be omitted, I typed that as:}\kern0.1\textwidth
{\tt
\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
\StartZaxdes\\
\hskip 0.5in\Startindex known\Endindex:ëNAME\\
\hskip 0.5in\Startindex birthday\Endindex:NAMEñDATE\\
\Sh{\Bigturnstile}\\
\hskip 0.5inknown = dom \ birthday\\
$\lfloor$\\
\end{tabular}}

Now a schema box:

È‚BirthdayBook1·
	names:Ü∞ãNAME
	dates:Ü∞ãDATE
	hwm:Ü
…
	Éi,j: 1 .. hwm é
		iàj ä names(i) à names(j)
 

\parbox[t]{0.6\textwidth}{The first line of that was typed
as:}
{\tt \Sh{\Topleft}\Startindex BirthdayBook1\Endindex}

\parbox[t]{0.6\textwidth}{Next, a generic constant box, typed
with a top line of:}
{\tt \Digamma[X]\Sh{\ParallelLines}\Sh{\ParallelLines}}

Î[X]¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸
›	‚\#·:íX ãÜ
…ÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕ
›	És:íXé
›		\#s=(án : Ü é Ñf:1 .. Ü   ê   Sétrue)
 

Like given type definitions,
the remaining three forms of paragraph (abbreviation
definition, free type definition and constraint)
are done with `\Sh{\StartZother}' and `\Sh{\EndML}':

Ë
	‚DATABASE·        ∂       ADDR ã PAGE

	‚TREE· ::= tip  |  forkæÜ â TREE â TREEø

	n_disks<5
Ê

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Formatting Rules} \label{AboutFRules}

Rule structures have three main parts, conventionally the name, the
assumptions, and the conclusions.  They are displayed thus:

=RULE			RULE
name
…
assumptions
…
conclusions
=TEX			END RULE

Each of the three parts may have multiple lines.  The name part is
always aligned centrally with the horizontal line.  There may be one or
two horizontal lines.  Additionally, each structure may be labelled,
the word `Rule' labels the above display.

Similar layouts are used for conversions, tactics and theorems.

\end{tabular}}

Significant points shown above are as follows.

\begin{itemize}

\item The name, assumptions and conclusions are given in that order and
	are separated by the large turnstile `\Sh{\Bigturnstile}' character,
	which should occur on a line on its own.

\item The use of the vertical `\Sh{\Vbar}' and horizontal `\Sh{\Hbar}' bars to
	make the source text more readable.

\item The type of rule box is indicated by the name after the equals
	`=' at the start of each rule, \ie, the \verb|=RULE| and
	\verb|=TACTIC| above.

\item The line \verb|=TEX| completes each rule.

\end{itemize}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{\LaTeX\ Environment For Rules}
\label{LatexPrimScreenAddn}

The rule environments are implemented with the \LaTeX\ environment 
{\tt Frule}.  It takes two parameters.  First, a single digit, either~1
or~2, indicating the number of horizontal lines wanted.  Second the
label for the rule environment, or an empty parameter if no label is
wanted.

Using the {\tt Frule} environment is directly analogous to using
the~\ref{NumParts} components shown below.  The first component becomes
a call of \verb|\begin{Frule}{}{}|, the last a call of
\verb|\end{Frule}|, and the large turnstiles `\Sh{\Bigturnstile}' are
calls of \verb|\crossbar|.

Within the name, assumptions and conclusions the lines of input must be
formatted according to the rules given in section~\ref{LinesOfInput},
this is most conveniently done by piping the text through the command
`{\tt doc2tex~-i}'.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Format of Rule Environments}

A rule environment contains the following~\ref{NumParts} parts,
in the stated order.

\begin{enumerate}

\item A line containing the rule type at its start, types are given in
	section~\ref{TypesOfRule} below.

\item The name part.

\item A large turnstile `\Sh{\Bigturnstile}' character with optional
	horizontal bars `\Sh{\Hbar}' on a line on their own.

\item The assumptions part.

\item Another large turnstile `\Sh{\Bigturnstile}' character with
	optional horizontal bars `\Sh{\Hbar}' on a line on their own.

\item The conclusions part.

\item \label{NumParts} Start another screening section, normally a line
	containing just the text {\tt =TEX}.

\end{enumerate}

Each of the name, assumptions and conclusions may comprise of several
lines, each of which may start with the optional vertical `\Sh{\Vbar}'
bar, if desired.  Lines in the assumptions and conclusions are
individually centered above or below the horizontal lines.  The name
part is left justified.  An example:

=CONVERSION
Name line 1
2
Third name line
…
Assumptions line 1
2
Third assumptions line
and the forth
…
First conclusions line
second
3
4, 4, 4, 4
fifth
=TEX

\parbox[t]{0.4\textwidth}{The source text
for this example is:}\kern0.1\textwidth
{\tt
\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
 =CONVERSION\\
Name line 1\\
2\\
Third name line\\
\Bigturnstile\\
Assumptions line 1\\
2\\
Third assumptions line\\
and the forth\\
\Bigturnstile\\
First conclusions line\\
second\\
3\\
4, 4, 4, 4\\
fifth\\
 =TEX
\end{tabular}}

Rule environments that contain only one large turnstile
`\Sh{\Bigturnstile}' character are assumed to contain just the name and
conclusion parts, those with no large turnstiles just the name part.
Any third or subsequent turnstile is ignored, any text that follows
them is treated as further lines of the conclusions.

Any rule environment with fewer, or greater, than two large turnstiles
`\Sh{\Bigturnstile}' characters will cause a warning message to be
written to the terminal and to the log file for the \LaTeX\ run.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Types of Rule} \label{TypesOfRule}

A small number of types of rule are provided, each indicated by the
name following the equals `=' at the start of each line.  Some types
have one horizontal line, and some two.  Types supported at present
are:  {\tt =CONVERSION, =RULE} and {\tt =THEOREM} with one horizontal
line; and, {\tt =TACTIC} with two horizontal lines.  All of these types
are illustrated within this document.

Other types of rule may easily be added by updating the {\tt
screenfile} with lines similar to those shown below.  (The {\tt
screenfile} is used by the {\tt screen} program, see
section~\ref{AboutScreen}.)

The {\tt screenfile} entries for the four types of rule listed in this
section are as follows.

{\hfuzz 4.6pt
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
RULE tex echo \\begin{Frule}1{Rule}; doc2tex -i ; echo \\end{Frule}
CONVERSION tex echo \\begin{Frule}1{Conversion}; doc2tex -i ; echo \\end{Frule}
THEOREM tex echo \\begin{Frule}1{Theorem}; doc2tex -i ; echo \\end{Frule}
TACTIC tex echo \\begin{Frule}2{Tactic}; doc2tex -i ; echo \\end{Frule}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
}

\subsection{Miscellaneous}

The final sort of environment, {\tt FT}, may be used for HOL output
or anything similar. It is invoked with `\StartFT'
followed by a name to be used as a title,
and ended with `\EndML'.

\subsection{Controlling The Layout}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Left and Right Margins} \label{AboutMargins}

The dimension registers \verb"\ftlmargin" and
\verb"\ftrmargin" may be used to adjust the additional
left and right margin space used for the boxes. These
are set to give no additional space by default.
If you use, for example,
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\ftlmargin=1.5in \ftrmargin=1.5in
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

you get the following:
{
\ftlmargin=1.5in \ftrmargin=1.5in
È‚BirthdayBook1·
	names : Ü∞ãNAME
	dates : Ü∞ãDATE
	hwm : Ü
…
	Éi,j: 1 .. hwm é
		iàjänames(i)ànames(j)
 
}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Page Breaks in Formal Text} \label{AboutFtLinePenalty}

The count register \verb"\ftlinepenalty" sets
the penalty which applies at the end of each line
of formal text in the various environments.
It is set to $10000$ by default.
This value means that no pagebreaks will be
allowed within such an environment.  If you want
to allow pagebreaks use \eg, \verb"\ftlinepenalty=0".

No page breaks are possible in rule environments, so changing the
value has no effect for rules.

It is recommended that large pieces of formal text, such as HOL theory
listings and some HOL proofs, that may spread across more than one page
are preceded with a \verb"\ftlinepenalty=0" so that \LaTeX\ may choose
convenient page breaks.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Tab Intervals} \label{AboutTabs}

In all of the environments tab characters are
interpreted specially and give typewriter-style
tabstops.  The size of the tabbing interval is
given by the dimension \verb"\tabstop" whose default
value is $1\over2$~inches.
For instance, in the example in section~\ref{AboutMargins}
above I have used one tab
at the beginning of each line but the last, which has two.
By putting tabs in before the colons
in the signature part of the schema, I can get
the types to line up in columns:

È‚BirthdayBook1·
	names	: Ü∞ ã NAME
	dates	: Ü∞ ã DATE
	hwm	: Ü
…
	Éi,j: 1 .. hwm é
		i à j  ä  names(i) à names(j)
 
It may require some experiment to get the right
number of tabs.
You can change the tabstop interval by setting
the dimension register \verb"\tabstop" to the
interval you want. \Eg, with
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\tabstop=1.0in
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

our example looks like:
{
\tabstop=1.0in
È‚BirthdayBook1·
	names	: Ü∞ãNAME
	dates	: Ü∞ãDATE
	hwm	: Ü
…
	Éi,j: 1 .. hwm é
		i à j  ä  names(i) à names(j)
 
}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Centering In Rule Environments}

Text in the assumptions and conclusions is normally centered above and
below the horizontal lines.  It may be left justified above by calling
the macro \verb|\FruleLeftJustify|.  An example of the use of this
command is in the next section,~\ref{TabsAndRules}.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Tabs In Rule Environments} \label{TabsAndRules}

The lines of input in rules may contain TAB characters for alignment
purposes in the same way that they may be used in other formal text
environments, but when the text is centered the alignment may not be as
expected.  It is recommended that TAB characters be used in rules {\em
only\/} when \verb|\FruleLeftJustify| has been selected.  An example of
the use of this command is as follows.

{
\FruleLeftJustify
=THEOREM
N	a	m	e
Name line without tabs
…
Tab-free assumption line
A	ssum	ptio	ns
Some more ass	unpt	ions
…
Conclus	ions
Furt	her c	onc	lusi	ons
Tab-free line
=TEX
}

\parbox[t]{0.4\textwidth}{Which was
produced with the following\\input text:}\kern0.1\textwidth
{\tt
\catcode`\^^I=\active
\def\TAB{\kern1pt\fbox{\it tab}\kern1pt}
\let^^I=\TAB
\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
\verb|{|\\
\verb|\|FruleLeftJustify\\
 =THEOREM\\
N	a	m	e\\
Name line without tabs\\
\Bigturnstile\\
Tab-free assumption line\\
A	ssum	ptio	ns\\
Some more ass	unpt	ions\\
\Bigturnstile\\
Conclus	ions\\
Furt	her c	onc	lusi	ons\\
Tab-free line\\
 =TEX\\
\verb|}|
\end{tabular}}

Omitting the \verb|\FruleLeftJustify| from this example causes the
following output.

{
=THEOREM
N	a	m	e
Name line without tabs
…
Tab-free assumption line
A	ssum	ptio	ns
Some more ass	unpt	ions
…
Conclus	ions
Furt	her c	onc	lusi	ons
Tab-free line
=TEX
}

Note how the tabs are not lined up, they appear to
give random gaps.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Line Numbers in \LaTeX\ Error Messages}

Error and warning messages produced by \LaTeX\ include line numbers,
these refer to the {\tt.tex} file that \LaTeX\ actually reads, not to
the {\tt.doc} file.  Whenever \LaTeX\ opens a file for reading it
prints an open bracket `{\tt(}' to the screen and the {\tt.log} file,
followed by the file name.  A matching closing bracket `{\tt)}' is
printed when \LaTeX\ closes the file.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{SUPPORTING PROGRAMS AND FILES}

The idiom for typesetting the literate script, {\tt myfile.doc} is:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
doc4tex myfile
tex4dvi myfile
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

This generates the file {\tt myfile.dvi} containing the \LaTeX\ output
for printing with {\tt pstex} or displaying with {\tt dvipage}.

The reason for having separate commands, {\tt doc4tex} and {\tt
tex4dvi}, is that one usually needs to run \LaTeX\ several times (\ie,
using {\tt tex4dvi} several times) to ensure that contents lists,
references and the like are all in step.

{\tt doc4tex}, {\tt tex4dvi} and the supporting utilities and files
are described in the following subsections.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{{\tt doc4tex\index{doc4tex}}}

This shell script takes a single command line option
which is the stem part of the name of a {\tt .tex}
file which is to be made from a {\tt .doc} file.
It uses {\tt sed}, {\tt screen} and {\tt doc2tex}
to do the transformation. The Standard~ML or HOL fragments in
the {\tt .doc} file may therefore be delimited either
using the {\tt screen} conventions (`{\tt =SML}', \etc)
or using the special characters (`\Sh{\StartML}', \etc).
The advantage of the combined approach is the ability
to control the inclusion, \eg, of diagnostic code
using the steering file, {\tt screenfile}, which
controls {\tt screen}.
If no steering file is present in the current
directory a default steering file suitable for most typical literate
scripts is used.

Note that using `\Sh{\StartML}' is normally preferred to using
`{\tt=SML}' for Standard~ML text.  The former allows are clear
distinction to be seen between the Standard~ML text and the embedded
HOL by printing them in different fonts.  The Standard~ML is printed
in an upright font.  An italic font is used for text surrounded by
either double quote characters `{\tt"}', as shown in
section~\ref{HOLExamples}, or by Strachey brackets `\Sh{ª}' and
`\Sh{º}'.  With `{\tt =SML}' all the text is displayed italic.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{{\tt tex4dvi\index{tex4dvi}}}

This shell script takes a single command line option which is the stem
part of the name of a {\tt .dvi} to be made from a {\tt .tex} file. It
runs \LaTeX\ once to generate the {\tt .dvi} file. If the \LaTeX\ run
has generated a {\tt .idx} file, this is sorted to produce a {\tt .sid}
file, otherwise an empty {\tt .sid} file is generated.  The {\tt .sid}
file is read by the \verb"\printindex" command.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{{\tt doc2tex\index{doc2tex}}}

This program is a filter which translates the {\tt .doc} format into
the {\tt .tex} format suitable for input to \LaTeX.  Most users will
wish to use {\tt doc4tex} rather than using {\tt doc2tex} directly.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{{\tt findfile\index{findfile}}}

This program allows shell scripts to be written without including
full path-names for steering files \etc \ It takes as command line
arguments a file name followed by a list of search paths in a
similar format to the shell's {\tt PATH} variable, \ie, a colon-separated
list of directory or file names, where a file name is taken to identify
the directory in which the file is contained. The C-shell's tilde
convention may be used in the names in the paths.
An example in a shell script might be:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
sed -f `findfile sedscript` $PATH $0`
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Here the file {\tt sedscript} is sought for first in the directories
in the users {\tt PATH} shell variable and then in the directory
identified by the name with which this script was invoked.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{{\tt screen}\index{screen} --- A General Literate Script Utility}
\label{AboutScreen}

The program {\tt screen} implements a general literate script
mechanism. It is used to implement the specific mechanisms for scripts
containing \LaTeX\ and Standard~ML.  Its description is a little more
complex than that of the other utilities. We follow the style of the
UNIX manual pages:

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection*{SYNOPSIS}

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
screen [-v] [-f steering_file] view
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection*{DESCRIPTION}

This program is a filter which enables a single text file
to be used to hold data for processing by a range of different
programs. The view argument is used to indicate which program screen is
preparing the output for. (The idea is similar to Knuth's Web
system).

Directive lines are used to indicate that portions of the file belong
to particular `categories', where a category is just a tag.  A steering
file relates categories to `views' which are also just tags.

If no {\tt -f} option is given the steering file is assumed to be called
`{\tt screenfile}'. If the name does not begin with a `{\tt /}' and does
not identify a file in the current directory the program looks for
the steering file in the directories named in the environment variable
$PATH$. A steering file suitable for handling most literate scripts
using pretty characters is included in the directory in which {\tt screen}
is installed and will be found by this search algorithm if a special
steering file has not been prepared.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection*{Steering File Format}

The steering file contains lines of the following forms:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
<category> <view> <filter>
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

This indicates that lines of category \verb/<category>/ are to be piped
through the command \verb/<filter>/ when screening to get view
\verb/<view>/. \ If no such line is present for a given category and
view then lines of that category are suppressed under that view.  The
\verb/<filter>/ may be omitted which is equivalent to using cat (but
faster). (The pipes are set up using popen(3S). Thus the
\verb/<filter>/ is interpreted by the Bourne shell sh(1)).  (A line of
this form may in fact be spread over several lines in the screenfile by
escaping the new line characters with backslash characters).

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
#<any text>
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Lines of this form are ignored (as in fact are blank lines).

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection*{Standard Input Format}

The directive lines in the standard input take the form:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
	=<category>
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

This indicates that the lines after the directive up to the next
directive or the end of the file are of category \verb/<category>/.
The `\verb/=/' must be the first character on the line. Text on a directive
line after the \verb/<category>/ is ignored
as is any text preceding the first directive.

Lines not starting with an `\verb/=/' character are processed according
to the category of the immediately preceding directive line.  Any lines
before the first directive line are ignored.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection*{EXAMPLE}

One might hold a program containing Fortran and C together
with its documentation using the following steering file:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
FORTRAN nroff ( echo .nf ; cat; echo .fi)
C nroff (echo .nf; cat; echo .fi)
C cc
FORTRAN f77
TEXT nroff
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

so that the code bits are included surrounded by \verb/.nf/ and \verb/.fi/
when the file is viewed to make a document and the relevant
languages only are presented when the file is viewed for compilation.

In the above example the input for screen might look like:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
	=TEXT
	This program ...
	=FORTRAN
	        SUBROUTINE ...
	=C
	        main() ...
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

A file inclusion facility might be implemented as an extension
of the above example with a screenfile line of the form

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
INCLUDE nroff cat `cat` | screen nroff
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection*{OPTIONS}

\verb/-v/ causes copious tracing on the standard error channel.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection*{LIMITS}

No more than 40 categories per view.
Input lines must be less than 1024 bytes long.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{{\tt screenfile}\index{screenfile} --- Steering file for {\tt screen}}

The standard {\tt screenfile} contains entries for all the \LaTeX\
environments described in this document.  If additional features are
required for a particular file then a copy of the file can be made,
and extended, in directory holding the document needing these
additional features..

%********************************************************************

\subsection{{\tt place\_large\_chars}\index{place\_large\_chars}}

This shell script invokes a text editor which acts as a 
palette containing large, easy-to-select, pretty characters
for pasting into documents.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{{\tt newzfont}\index{newzfont} --- A Font File}

This file is a font file for use with literate scripts containing
pretty characters.  It provides all the standard ASCII characters
together with the pretty characters.
