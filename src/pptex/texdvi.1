.SH NAME
texdvi \-  generate a .dvi file and a .sid file from a .tex file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B texdvi
[-v] [-b] [-p TeX_program_name] <filename> ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Shell script that runs LaTeX on each of the
.B "filename"
arguments
to produce the corresponding
.I ".dvi"
file.  These arguments may be
just the base-name, perhaps with a directory name prefix, or may include the
.I ".tex"
suffix.  When the
.B "-v"
option is set details of the
.I ".tex"
and
.I ".dvi"
files read and
written are shown on the standard output.  To support indexing this
script ensures that a
.I ".sid"
file exists before LaTeX is called;
when LaTeX completes any
.I ".idx"
file is sorted to create
a
.I ".sid"
file ready for the next time
.I "texdvi"
is used.  When
initially producing a
.I ".dvi"
file
.I "texdvi"
will need to be run
up to four times so that the derived information such as tables of
contents and inter-page references stabilise.
.LP
The LaTeX program is
.I "latex"
by default but a different program
may be specified with the
.B "-p"
option.
.LP
If the
.B "-b"
option is supplied, the BibTeX program is run after running LaTeX.
