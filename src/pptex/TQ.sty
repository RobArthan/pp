%% TPP style file is in various parts:
%% **	to set page sizes large
%% **	to redefine some LaTeX article style commands
%% **	for defining frameworks for page headers and footers
%% **	for TPP style front page
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%% For big pages
%% **	Uses more of the page for text.
%% **	No margins.
%% **	Have vertical space between paragraphs, and no hanging indents.
%% **	Alter table of contents and bibliography commands to not
%%	produce any section titles.
%% **	Make footnote separating rule full page width.
%% ** 	Show dates.

%  `\FormatDate{}' formats a date in the style: `YY/MM/DD', as
%	produced by sccs and similar, in the form `DD Monthname 19YY'.
%	If the argument is empty (as in `\FormatDate{}') then today's
%	date is used.  Thus a good way to use it in an sccs controlled
%	document is with the `percent E percent' keyword (for the
%	next few lines `%' will be shown as `$' so that sccs will not
%	expand `$E$' in this explanatory text):
%		\FormatDate{$E$$
%		} 
%	So that if the $E$ macro has not been expanded you get today's
%	date, because the first `percent' is taken as TeX's start of
%	comment.  Note the double `percent' in `$E$$', this prevents
%	the end-of-line before the final `}' being treated as a space.

%%	Style to generate front pages of documents in the TPP
%%	document style.  Based on [AW...] issue ..., version...
%%
%% **	Defines lots of macros, general style is that macros with an
%%	`@' are used in creating the front page, and may be deleted
%%	when it is actually produced.  A few macros are left after the
%%	front page is produced, for use in (eg) page headers and
%%	footers, they are:
%%	      \TPPheadtitle
%%
%% **	The abstract is treated in a strange manner, the aim being to
%%	allow multi-paragraph abstracts.  This is done with a
%%	`TPPabstract' environment, it means a little more typing for
%%	the users of short abstracts, but gives the flexibility for
%%	long abstracts.
%%

% First set some default values for front page entries.  Default
% for many is to output almost nothing at all

%   Authors:
%	Use either \TPPauthors{} or \TPPauthor{}.  They give
%	the same effect, except that \TPPauthors{} outputs the
%	line title ``Authors'' and \TPPauthor{} outputs ``Author''.
%	See also the section below on Authorisation and Authors.
%   Authorisation:
%	To get an authorisation entry use \TPPauthorisation{}.
%   Authorisation and Authors:
%	The  Authorisation, Author and Authors entries requires are a
%	four column LaTeX tabular environments, containing: name,
%	function, signature, and date.  (Author has location rather
%	than function).  Multiple authorisation entries can be obtained
%	by having several table rows.  Eg:
%		\TPPauthorisation{name1 & func1 & sig1 & date1\\
%			name2 & func2 & sig2 & date2}
%   Distribution:
%	This is a simple text field, to get multiple
%	distributions use some sort of table, eg:
%		\begin{tabular}{@{\hspace{1.1in}}l} ...
%	Or, for a distribution list with addresses etc, use
%	a table with several columns.
%
% These macros are called after the \begin{document}.
