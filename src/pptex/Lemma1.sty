%  `\FormatDate{}' formats a date in the style: `YY/MM/DD', as
%	produced by sccs and similar, in the form `DD Monthname 19YY'.
%	If the argument is empty (as in `\FormatDate{}') then today's
%	date is used.  Thus a good way to use it in an sccs controlled
%	document is with the `percent E percent' keyword (for the
%	next few lines `%' will be shown as `$' so that sccs will not
%	expand `$E$' in this explanatory text):
%		\FormatDate{$E$
%		} 
%	So that if the $E$ macro has not been expanded you get today's
%	date, because the first `percent' is taken as TeX's start of
%	comment.
%
%	Note the `\number#3\relax\space' for the day.  The `\number#3'
%	part removes any leading zeroes and trailing spaces in argument
%	3.  Leading zeroes come from SCCS.  Trailing spaces may come
%	from the `$E$\n}' where the `\n' is treated as a space, in an
%	alternative form of `{$E$$\n}' the extra `$' (actually `%')
%	means that there is no space.  The definition of `\number' is
%	that it allows, and consumes <one optional space> (see the
%	TeXbook, page 269), without the `\relax' then that space may be
%	the explicit one we give here.  The combination of `\number'
%	and `\relax' means that trailing spaces are suppressed, and
%	that one space is included between day and month.
