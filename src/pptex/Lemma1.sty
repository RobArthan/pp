%  `\FormatDate{}' formats a date in the style: `YY/MM/DD', as
%	produced by sccs and similar, in the form `DD Monthname 19YY'.
%	If the argument is empty (as in `\FormatDate{}') then today's
%	date is used.  Thus a good way to use it in an sccs controlled
%	document is with the `percent E percent' keyword (for the
%	next few lines `%' will be shown as `*' so that sccs will not
%	expand `*E*' in this explanatory text):
%		\FormatDate{*E*
%		}
%	So that if the *E* macro has not been expanded you get today's
%	date, because the first `percent' is taken as TeX's start of
%	comment.
%
%	Note the `\number#3\relax\space' for the day.  The `\number#3'
%	part removes any leading zeroes and trailing spaces in argument
%	3.  Leading zeroes come from SCCS.  Trailing spaces may come
%	from the `*E*\n}' where the `\n' is treated as a space, in an
%	alternative form of `{*E**\n}' the extra `*' (actually `%')
%	means that there is no space.  The definition of `\number' is
%	that it allows, and consumes <one optional space> (see the
%	TeXbook, page 269), without the `\relax' then that space may be
%	the explicit one we give here.  The combination of `\number'
%	and `\relax' means that trailing spaces are suppressed, and
%	that one space is included between day and month.
%
%	This is now extended to cope with inputs of the form `YY/MM/DD'
%	or `YYYY/MM/DD' optionally followed by a space then something else.
%	The something else is discarded. This caters for RCS Date substitutions
%	which include a time after the date. FormatDateAux requires a space
%	after operand 3. FormatDate tacks on a date and a dummy operand 4
%	to cater for the SCCS format with no time field. If the time field
%	is their TeX matches the first space and so discards the time
%	along with the dummy operand.
%	To permit RCS style keywords in documents checked for editing
%	an argument beginning with a $ is also permitted and treated
%	the same as an empty argument. Use `co -kv' with RCS to get
%	the proper dates inserted when the document has been checked in.
