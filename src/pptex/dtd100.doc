\subsection{Scope}

This document contains the detailed design of the documents
transforming utility programs whose detailed design is
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD100}.  The user interface is described in the
user documentation for the document processing
system~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR001}.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}

Processing documents to obtain a printed form or a {\tt.sml} file for
further processing are a sufficiently common operations to merit having
some shell scripts that package these calls in a standard manner.
Document files, with the {\tt.doc} suffix, may be sieved to produce
both {\tt.tex} and {\tt.sml} files; then {\tt.tex} files are further
processed by \LaTeX{} to get the {\tt.dvi} file for printing.  These
transformations are all to get a file of one suffix from a file with
the same base-name but a different suffix.  Thus we name the shell
scripts according to these suffixes.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Dependencies}

These programs use the sieve program, see~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD053},
they are written as Bourne Shell scripts (see {\tt sh(1)} of the Sun
UNIX manual set) and require some of the utilities found with the Unix
operating system.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Interface}

The user interface is described in the user documentation for the
document processing system~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR001}.

\section{THE SHELL SCRIPTS}

%doc2man_description:extract TeX or Standard ML view of a ProofPower document
=DOC
€doctex› [-v] [-f view_file_name] [-e edit_script]
		[-K] [-k keyword_file_name] <filename> ...
€docsml› [-v] [-f view_file_name] [-K] [-k keyword_file_name] <filename> ...
=DESCRIBE
Shell scripts that sieve each of their $filename$ arguments to produce
various output files.  These arguments may be given just as the
base-name, perhaps with a directory name prefix, or may include the {\tt.doc} suffix.  When the $-v$ option is
set details of the files read and written are shown on the standard
output.  The default steering files are named {\tt sieveview} and {\tt
sievekeyword} and looked for first in the current directory, second on
the callers execution path (from the UNIX environment variable
{\tt\$PATH}).
The default viewfile may be changed with the $-f$ option.
The default keyword file may be suppressed with the $-K$ option.
Additional keyword files may be given with the $-k$ option which may be used
several times.
The $-e$ option identifies the name of a script of {\tt ex} commands which are used to edit the {\tt .tex} file.

The output file from {\tt doctex} has suffix {\tt .tex} and is intended for processing with {\tt texdvi}.
The output file from {\tt docsml} has suffix {\tt .sml} and is typically processed by loading
it into a {\Product} database.

%doc2man_description: generate a .dvi file and a .sid file from a .tex file
=DOC
€texdvi› [-v] [-b] [-p TeX_program_name] <filename> ...
=DESCRIBE
Shell script that runs \LaTeX{} on each of the $filename$ arguments
to produce the corresponding {\tt.dvi} file.  These arguments may be
just the base-name, perhaps with a directory name prefix, or may include the {\tt.tex} suffix.  When the $-v$
option is set details of the {\tt.tex} and{\tt.dvi} files read and
written are shown on the standard output.  To support indexing this
script ensures that a {\tt.sid} file exists before \LaTeX{} is called;
when \LaTeX{} completes any {\tt.idx} file is sorted to create
a{\tt.sid} file ready for the next time {\tt texdvi} is used.  When
initially producing a {\tt.dvi} file {\tt texdvi} will need to be run
up to four times so that the derived information such as tables of
contents and inter-page references stabilise.

The \LaTeX{} program is {\tt latex} by default but a different program
may be specified with the $-p$ option.

If the {\tt -b} option is specified, {\tt bibtex} is run after running {\tt latex}.

%doc2man_description: produce a .dvi file from a ProofPower document
=DOC
€docdvi› [-v] [-f view_file_name] [-K] [-k keyword_file_name]
	[-e edit_file_name] [-p TeX_program_name] [-%calN%] <filename> ...
=DESCRIBE
Shell script that combines the actions of {\tt doctex}, {\tt bibtex}
(which is part of the basic \TeX{} distribution) and {\tt texdvi} with
the intention of fully processing a simple document from its {\tt.doc}
form to a printable {\tt.dvi} file.

The option $-\cal N$ controls how
many times \LaTeX{} should be invoked, the default is three (i.e.,
`$-3$'), the values of $\cal N$ may be in the range one to four
inclusive.
The other options are as for {\tt doctex} and {\tt texdvi}.

\LaTeX{} and {\tt bibtex} are run so that if they detect
errors and prompt for input they will read an end of file and thus stop
immediately.

In some cases an extra run of \LaTeX{} may be required.  In these cases
\LaTeX{} will output the message: `{\em LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may
have changed. Rerun to get cross-references right.}'

%doc2man_description: convert between the ASCII and extended character set formats for a ProofPower document
=DOC
€conv_ascii› [-r] [-K] [-k keyword_file_name] <filename> ...
€conv_extended› [-r] [-K] [-k keyword_file_name] <filename> ...
=DESCRIBE
$conv\_ascii$ converts \Product\ documents using the extended
character set into ASCII keyword format. $conv\_extended$ performs
the opposite conversion.

The $filename$ arguments may be just the
base-name, perhaps with a directory name prefix, or may include the {\tt.doc} suffix. By default,
the result of the conversion is checked by
converting in the opposite direction and comparing with the input.
If the check is successful, the {\tt.doc}
file is then replaced by the result of the conversion.
If the conversion appears to be unsuccessful the output of the conversion
is placed in a file with suffix {\tt.asc} or {\tt.ext} in the current directory, and the {\tt.doc} file is
left unchanged.

If $-r$ is specified no check is made and the output of the conversion is placed
in a file with suffix {\tt.asc} or {\tt.ext}.

Note that the check will always fail on a file containing a mixture of extended
characters and ASCII keywords. Use $-r$ and then, if all is well, overwrite
the {\tt.doc} file with the {\tt.asc} or {\tt.ext} file using $mv(1)$ or $cp(1)$
to convert a such file into a homogeneous one.

The check will also fail if the file is already in the desired format,
in which case there is no need to run the conversion program.

The $-K$ and $-k$ options indicate the
keyword files to be used as for $doctex$ and $docsml$ (and are only
needed if fonts other than those supplied with \Product\ are being used.)

{\it docpr}

%doc2man_extra:.I "USR001: ProofPower - Document Preparation"

=ENDDOC

The rationale of having the default of the $-\cal N$ option being three
is because the outputs of successive runs of \LaTeX{} are as follows,
assuming before the first that there is only the {\tt.doc} file
present.  Recall that \LaTeX{} produces the table of contents and index
entries by writing to auxiliary files which are read in during
subsequent executions.  The default could be four but the number of
occasions when that is required would appear to be outweighed by the
time taken to run \LaTeX{} the extra time.

\begin{itemize}

\item Start with only the {\tt.doc} file present.

\item[1] Create {\tt.aux}, {\tt.idx} and {\tt.dvi} files with no space
	in the {\tt.dvi} file for table of contents, index or
	bibliographies.

\item Run {\tt bibtex} to create a {\tt.bbl} file.

\item[2] Now the {\tt.dvi} file has space for table of contents, etc.,
	but these all items have the page numbers from the first run.

\item[3] Produce a {\tt.dvi} file with correct page numbers.

\item[4] In some cases an extra run is required to stabilise the
	contents of the {\tt.dvi} file, this is due to execution~3
	inserting longer page numbers and bibliographic references
	which may cause different line and page breaks than those
	inserted by execution~2.

\item In some pathological cases the output may not stabilise, this is
	mentioned in the \LaTeX{} book~\cite[page~70]{Lamport86}.

\end{itemize}

%doc2man_description:print out files containing ProofPower symbols verbatim
=DOC
€docpr› [-n] [-p] [-s] [-v] [-w width] <filename> ...
=DESCRIBE
Shell script that prints out files that may contain extended characters
in a verbatim-like manner.  Lines may be numbered in the output by
using the $-n$ option.  Lines are folded at at~80 characters wide, or
at the width given by the $-w\;\;width$ option.  The output may be
viewed on screen with the $-s$ option, the default is to print the
output.  By default all intermediate files are deleted, with the $-p$
option the {\tt.dvi} file will be preserved.  With the $-v$ option
details of the files processed are listed on the standard output.
