\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Scope}
This document gives the detailed design for utilities for working with Unicode in {\Product}.

\subsection{Purpose and Background}
See \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD011}.

\section{THE SIGNATURE}

This module creates two C header files pputf8tab.h and utf8pptab.h containing tables defining the mapping between \Product{} extended character codes and unicode points, and provides two programs which convert files between the two representations.

The header files are available for use by any other programs which might undertake similar translations, the programs are supplied as a part of \Product{} release.

€utf8pp› <infile >outfile
=DESCRIBE
€pputf8› translates from the \Product{} extended character set into unicode characters in utf8 format.
It will also translate into unicode utf8 any keywords of the form \%x{\it HHHHHH}\%, where {\it HHHHHH} is the upper case hexadecimal representation of the code point, or of the form \%\&{\it name}\% where {\it name} is the name of a character entity as defined in the HTML 4.0 W3C standard.

€utf8pp› translates from unicode characters in utf8 formal into the \Product{} extended character set where exteneded characters are available.
Otherwise it will use an HTML 4.0 entity name, if one exists, in the form \%\&name\% or failing that it will use the character code in the form \%x{\it HHHHHH}\%, where {\it HHHHHH} is the upper case hexadecimal representation of the code point.
