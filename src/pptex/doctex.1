.SH SYNOPSIS
.B doctex
[-v] [-f view_file_name] [-e edit_script]

[-v] [-f view_file_name] [-K] [-k keyword_file_name] <filename> ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Shell scripts that sieve each of their
.B "filename"
arguments to produce
various output files.  These arguments may be given just as the
base-name, perhaps with a directory name prefix, or may include the
.I ".doc"
suffix.  When the
.B "-v"
option is
set details of the files read and written are shown on the standard
output.  The default steering files are named
.I "sieveview"
and {\tt
sievekeyword} and looked for first in the current directory, second on
the callers execution path (from the UNIX environment variable
.IR "\$PATH" ).
The default viewfile may be changed with the
.B "-f"
option.
The default keyword file may be suppressed with the
.B "-K"
option.
Additional keyword files may be given with the
.B "-k"
option which may be used
several times.
The
.B "-e"
option identifies the name of a script of
.I "ex"
commands which are used to edit the
.I ".tex"
file.
.LP
