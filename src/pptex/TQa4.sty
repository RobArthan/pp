%% TQa4 style file is in various parts:
%% **	to set page sizes large
%% **	to redefine some LaTeX article style commands
%% **	for defining frameworks for page headers and footers
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% For big pages
% *	Uses more of the page for text.
% *	No margins.
% *	Have vertical space between paragraphs, and no hanging indents.
% *	Make default header empty and 0pt high
% *	Alter table of contents and bibliography commands to not
%	produce any section titles.
% *	Make footnote separating rule full page width.
% * 	Show dates.

% To get vertical space between paragraphs, and no hanging indents.

%	Page default layout.  See TUGboat, Volume 9 (1988) No 1 pp78-82
%	`Page Layout in LaTeX'.
%
%	Values used here for `\voffset' and `\hoffset' should not
%	include any fudge-factors to allow for the poor alignment of
%	the print engine onto the paper, such alignment problems
%	are the domain of the printer and its drivers.
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%  Vertical layout

%	LaTeX default is to have 1in top margin, Want 0.7in top and
%	bottom margin.  Thus on A4 paper, 11.6in high, have 10.2in of
%	available paper.
\voffset -0.3in

%	Working from the top of the paper downwards.

%				Gap from edge of top margin to top of
%				header area.
\topmargin	0pt

%				Hight of header area.
\headheight	0pt

%				Gap between header area and main text area.
\headsep	0pt

%				Hight of main text area.
\textheight	 9.7in

%				Hight of footer plus gap between main
%				text area and footer.
\footskip	 0.5in
%	Total =	10.2in


\footheight 30pt
%				Dimension `\footheight' is taken out
%				of `\footskip'.


%--------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Horizontal layout

%	LaTeX default is to have 1in left margin, Want 0.8in left and
%	right margin.  Thus on A4 paper, 8.2in wide, have 6.6in of
%	available paper.

\hoffset -0.2in

\textwidth 6.6in

% Do not provide space for marginal notes
\marginparpush 0pt
\marginparsep 0pt

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%  Default is to use a large amount of the page, but this is not
%  compatible with programs like `dvisun' which expect `\hoffset=0pt'
%  and `\voffset=0pt'.  To allow viewing the file complete with its
%  headers and LHS margin use the macro `\TPPsmallpage'.  Note that page
%  boundaries will change if this macro is used, because of the changes
%  to `\textheight' and `\textwidth'.

\def\TPPsmallpage{%
\textheight = 8.5in
\textwidth 6in
\hoffset 0pt
\voffset 0pt

%  `\FormatDate{}' formats a date in the style: `YY/MM/DD', as
%	produced by sccs and similar, in the form `DD Monthname 19YY'.
%	If the argument is empty (as in `\FormatDate{}') then today's
%	date is used.  Thus a good way to use it in an sccs controlled
%	document is with the `percent E percent' keyword (for the
%	next few lines `%' will be shown as `$' so that sccs will not
%	expand `$E$' in this explanatory text):
%		\FormatDate{$E$
%		} 
%	So that if the $E$ macro has not been expanded you get today's
%	date, because the first `percent' is taken as TeX's start of
%	comment.
%
%	Note the `\number#3\relax\space' for the day.  The `\number#3'
%	part removes any leading zeroes and trailing spaces in argument
%	3.  Leading zeroes come from SCCS.  Trailing spaces may come
%	from the `$E$\n}' where the `\n' is treated as a space, in an
%	alternative form of `{$E$$\n}' the extra `$' (actually `%')
%	means that there is no space.  The definition of `\number' is
%	that is allows, and consumes <one optional space> (see the
%	TeXbook, page 269), without the `\relax' then that space may be
%	the explicit one we give here.  The combination of `\number'
%	and `\relax' means that trailing spaces are suppressed, and
%	that one space is included between day and month.

% Page numbering.
%
%	Define the page style `TPPplain', which is like the LaTeX plain
%	page style, but shows ``N of M'' rather than just `N'.
%
%	Define \TPPNumPages to be number of pages in the document,
%	write it to the .aux file ready for the "next" run of LaTeX.
%	Use a default of `??' for the first run.  This is written out
%	by `\TPPwritepageno' which is called by page style `TPPplain'.
%	Other page styles wanting the number of pages in the document
%	should call `\TPPwritepageno' as the last thing done in both
%	`\@oddfoot' and `\@evenfoot', as is done in `\ps@TPPplain'.
