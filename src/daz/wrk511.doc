\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document reports on a the attempt on proving the SHOLIS VCs called for in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/PLN010,ISS/HAT/DAZ/PLN012}.
\subsection{Introduction}
As part of the requirements analysis for proof tools for the Compliance Notation, an attempt has been made at proving the VCs arising from one package from the SHOLIS development.

The method adopted was to load up the Z document supplied with the ITT \cite{CSM/025} and then to attempt to prove the VCs with a view to identifying important issues.
Some prototyping of {\em ad hoc} tactics to discharge the more trivial VCs was also carried out and of more general tools which were found useful.

\begin{description}
\item[Section \ref{PROGRESS}] reports on the progress made with proofs.
\item[Section \ref{DISCUSSION}] summarises what was learnt from the proof attempts.
\item[Section \ref{RECOMMENDATIONS}] gives some recommendations for future work on proof procedures.
\end{description}

\section{PROGRESS WITH THE PROOFS}\label{PROGRESS}
\subsection{Process}
The work began by loading the Z document supplied with the ITT.
The Z document required only one modification, namely to comment out the line which makes a new parent of the cache theory for the database in which the Z document was created.

Proofs of the VCs were then attempted in turn with a view to identifying important issues.
It was found that many of the VCs permit proofs following some very simple common patterns. E.g., many of the VCs are universally quantified tautologies or become such after simple transformations.
{\em Ad hoc} tactics were written to automate these proofs and these were able to discharge ?? of the 62 VCs automatically.

Since the Z document had been prepared using version 0.5 of the tool, which does not include the enhanced treatment of SPARK record aggregates.
Initially, any $\mu$ expressions arising from record aggregates were translated manually into the new binding display format.
When the original literate script was made available, a new Z document was generated using the version 0.6 tool.
Subsequent proof work concentrated on the new VCs (which were found to differ from the original ones only in respect of the changed treatment of record aggregates).

$vc702\_2$ was found to be unprovable. This seemed to come from leaving the brackets out of two predicates of the form
=INLINEFT
Inv ± (A ¤ B)
=TEX
\ in the corresponding specification statement.
Inserting the missing brackets made the VC provable (without making the other VCs affected by the change unprovable).

$vc902\_2$ and $vc120704\_2$ are suspected to be unprovable; however, the problems have not yet been traced back to the original script.

\subsection{The Proofs}
TBA - two tables: one listing VCs; the other listing lemmas needed.

Is it worth trying to classify the proofs along the lines of:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
Class & Description \\
A & Can be proved automatically \\
B & Straightforward \\
CZ & Lengthy or involved because of structure of Z \\
CC & Lengthy or involved because of Compliance Tool shortcomings \\
\end{tabular}
