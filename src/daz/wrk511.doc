\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document reports on a the attempt on proving the SHOLIS VCs called for in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/PLN010,ISS/HAT/DAZ/PLN012}.
\subsection{Introduction}
As part of the requirements analysis for proof tools for the Compliance Notation, an attempt has been made at proving the VCs arising from one package from the SHOLIS development.

The method adopted was to load up the Z document supplied with the ITT \cite{CSM/235} and then to attempt to prove the VCs with a view to identifying important issues.
Some prototyping of {\em ad hoc} tactics to discharge the more trivial VCs was also carried out and of more general tools which were found useful.

Three of the VCs were found to be unprovable because of minor errors in the specification statements giving rise to them. Two of these three errors were corrected and so all but one of the 62 VCs have been proved.

The structure of the rest of this document is as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[Section \ref{PROGRESS}] reports on the progress made with proofs.
\item[Section \ref{DISCUSSION}] summarises what was learnt from the proof attempts.
\item[Section \ref{RECOMMENDATIONS}] gives some recommendations for future work on proof procedures.
\end{description}

\newpage
\section{PROGRESS WITH THE PROOFS}\label{PROGRESS}
\subsection{Approach}
The work began by loading the Z document supplied with the ITT.
The Z document required only one modification, namely to comment out the line which makes a new parent of the cache theory for the database in which the Z document was created.

Proofs of the VCs were then attempted in turn with a view to identifying important issues.
It was found that many of the VCs permit proofs following some very simple common patterns. E.g., many of the VCs are universally quantified tautologies or become such after simple transformations.
{\em Ad hoc} tactics were written to automate these proofs and these were able to discharge 28 of the 62 VCs automatically.


The Z document had been prepared using version 0.5 of the tool, which does not include the enhanced treatment of SPARK record aggregates.
Initially, any $\mu$ expressions arising from record aggregates were translated manually into the new binding display format.
When the original literate script was made available, a new Z document was generated using the version 0.6 tool.
Subsequent proof work concentrated on the new VCs (which were found to differ from the original ones only in respect of the changed treatment of record aggregates).


\subsection{Unprovable VCs}\label{UV}
Three of the VCs were found to be unprovable.
The problems were traced back to specification statements in the original literate script and an evident correction enabled proof of two of the three.
The remaining VC apparently requires a slightly more substantive change to the  script and a fix has not been attempted.
The rest of this section describes the problematic VCs in more detail.

\paragraph{$vc702\_2$} The problem with this VC seemed to come from leaving the brackets out of two predicates of the form
=INLINEFT
Inv ± (A ¤ B)
=TEX
\ in the corresponding specification statement.
Inserting the missing brackets made the VC provable, and made the proofs of related VCs simpler.

\paragraph{$vc902\_2$} Again, the problem seemed to have arisen from missing brackets. In this case, the brackets had been omitted from an arithmetic expression of the form
=INLINEFT
(x - y) + z
=TEX
\ in the corresponding specification statement.
As before, inserting the missing brackets made the VC provable.
In this case, correcting the specification statement did not make any related VCs unprovable, but it did make the proofs of related VCs a little harder, since, a side-effect of the error was to reduce the number of cases needed in some arithmetic facts.

\paragraph{$vc120704\_2$}  This VC arises from the
first step in refining the body of a for-loop, with loop parameter
$ATYPE$, in the $ACCEPTALARM$ procedure.

The loop is intended to make all components of the arrays $STATE$ and
$TIMERS$ satisfy a certain predicate (given by renaming the conjunction
of the schemas $FirstAcceptance$, $NoAcceptance$ and
$InactiveAcceptance$).

The pre-condition for the refinement of the loop body requires that the
$ATYPE$-th components of the arrays should not have been changed by
earlier iterations and that the values of the arrays before execution
of the loop should have satisfied a certain condition.  The
pre-condition gives no information about any components of the arrays
on the current iteration other than the $ATYPE$-th ones.

The post-condition insists that only the $ATYPE$-th components of the
arrays should have changed and that the desired condition should now
hold of the $ATYPE$-th components.  The post-condition does not require
that the desired condition hold for the  components which have been
processed on previous iterations, nor is this implied by the
pre-condition.

The pre- and post-conditions seem therefore to make true statements
which are too weak for the resulting VCs to be provable.  It seems
plausible that the proofs would go through if this step were simply
skipped, i.e., if the loop body were refined directly to code.
However, this adjustment to the script has not been attempted.



\newpage
\subsection{The Proofs}

In order to prove the VCs, two classes of auxiliary lemmas were used. The first class comprises general purpose lemmas, described in section \ref{GENPUR}, and the second class comprises application specific lemmas, described in section \ref{APPSPEC}.

An attempt has been made to classify the 61 VC proofs as follows:

\begin{tabular}{llp{5in}}
{\bf Class} & {\bf Number} & {\bf Description} \\
& &\\
{\bf A} & 28 & Can be proved automatically. \\
{\bf B} & 9 & Straightforward to prove manually. Automatic proof typically fails either because stripping needs to be carefully controlled, or because linear arithmetic is required. No expansion of specification definitions needed. Auxiliary results not required. \\
{\bf C} & 15 & May require a single phase of expansion of definitions; in-depth understanding of specification not necessary; auxiliary lemmas usually required. \\
{\bf D} & 9 & More subtle use of definitions necessary, e.g., to work out case-selection criteria for membership of a schema conjunction; auxiliary lemmas required. \\
\end{tabular}

A summary of the 61 VC proofs with respect to this classification is given in tables \ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2}.
These tables also give some comments about the proofs where appropriate.
In particular, the comments indicate which definitions were used for proofs in classes C and D.

The specification contains several  Z paragraphs (e.g., the definition of $VisualFlashAlarms$) involving predicates of the form:
=INLINEFT
µx:X· x  A ¤ p
=TEX
. These predicates generally have to be used as conditional rewrite rule:
=INLINEFT
x  X ´ (x  A ¤ p)
=TEX
.
Unfortunately, the forward chaining tactics as currently supplied do not work well with such rewrite rules (they
treat the predicate as if it were
=INLINEFT
x  X ´ x  A ´ p
=TEX
\ and then fail to find an assumption to match
=INLINEFT
x  A
=TEX
) .
A variant forward chaining tactic which solves this rather severe usability problem was prototyped and found very useful in the proofs.

\subsection{General Purpose Lemmas} \label {GENPUR}
The 22 lemmas described in this section are general purpose results that arise from particular SPARK constructs. They fall into four groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Results about override, $«$
\item
Results about
=INLINEFT
not True
=TEX
\item
Results about $intmod$
\item
Results about
=INLINEFT
X ¸ {y}
=TEX
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Override Lemmas}\label{OVER}
The occurrence of functional overrides in the VCs arise from SPARK array assignments. Eight lemmas have been proven,
=INLINEFT
«_lemma1 to «_lemma8
=TEX
\ For example:
=GFT
«_lemma4
ô [X,Y,Z](µ f : X ­ Y ­ Z; x : X; y : Y; z : Z
    · (f « {x í f x « {y í z}}) x y = z)
=TEX
is used in the proof of $vc807\_1$ to verify that

=GFT
(STATE
                  « {DISPLAY
                        í STATE DISPLAY
                            « {ATYPE
                                  í (LEVEL ¦ AUDIOVISUALFLASH, RAISED ¦ Boolean true,
                                      REOCCURS ¦ NORESET)}})
		DISPLAY ATYPE =
	(LEVEL ¦ AUDIOVISUALFLASH,RAISED ¦ TRUE, REOCCURS ¦ NORESET)
=TEX
where $STATE$ is an $ALARMSTATE$, $DISPLAY$ is of type $BASICTYPESoDISPLAYPOSITION$ and $ATYPE$ is an $ALARMTYPE$.
\subsubsection{``not TRUE'' lemmas}\label{NT}
Two lemmas, $bool\_lemma1$ and $bool\_lemma2$ are provided.
\ For example:
=GFT
bool_lemma1
ô µ X : BOOLEAN · not X = Boolean true ´ X = Boolean false
=TEX
There are many cases in the proofs where one has to use the fact that

=GFT
not (STATE DISPLAY ATYPE).RAISED = FALSE
=TEX
\ is equivalent to

=GFT
(STATE DISPLAY ATYPE).RAISED = TRUE
=TEX

The compliance tool is unable to deduce this automatically because it requires expansion of definitions to demonstrate that
\newline
=INLINEFT
(STATE DISPLAY ATYPE).RAISED  BOOLEAN.
=TEX
\newline
$bool\_lemma1$ is used in conjunction with this membership result to achieve the desired equivalence.
\subsubsection{Intmod Lemmas}
The proof of $vc901\_2$ requires reasoning about $intmod$, used in the specification of $TimeoutAlarm$. There are 8 lemmas in this group:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$mod\_lemma1$
\item
$mod\_lemma2$
\item
$¼\_times\_zero\_lemma$
\item
$minus\_times\_zero\_lemma$
\item
$intmod\_mod\_lemma1$
\item
$intmod\_mod\_lemma2$
\item
$intmod\_lemma1$
\item
$intmod\_lemma2$
\end{itemize}
The first 6 of the above are  subsidiary results used to prove the two main lemmas of this section:
=GFT
intmod_lemma1
ô µ i : î; j : î · j > i ´ i intmod j = i
intmod_lemma2
ô µ i : ú; j : î · i < 0 ± j > ~ i ´ i intmod j = j + i
=TEX
They are used directly in the proof of $vc901\_2$ which consists essentially of a case analysis on
=GFT
CURRENTTIME - (TIMERS DISPLAY ATYPE).TIMEOUT ¾ 0
²
CURRENTTIME - (TIMERS DISPLAY ATYPE).TIMEOUT < 0
=TEX
\subsubsection{Singleton Set Lemmas}
There are four results in this section:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$¸\_singleton\_fun\_lemma$
\item
$singleton\_¸\_fun\_lemma$
\item
$¸\_singleton\_app\_lemma$
\item
$singleton\_¸\_app\_lemma$
\end{itemize}
For example:
=GFT
singleton_¸_fun_lemma
ô µ x : ƒ; y : ƒ; z : ƒ · {x} ¸ {y}  {x} ­ z ¤ y  z
=TEX
The need for these lemmas arises from the use of the SPARK array aggregates in the package initialisation ($vc1501\_1$) and the procedure which resets the package state ($vc1001\_1$).


\subsection{Application Specific Lemmas} \label {APPSPEC}
All the 13 results in this section are application specific.  They are proven as separate lemmas either because they are results that are found to be needed repeatedly during the process of proving the VCs, or because proving them in isolation is simpler than proving them in the context of a VC proof. The lemmas have been named to correspond to a VC, but this is simply the first VC encountered that requires that partiular subsidiary result. For example, $vc501\_lemma$ is the lemma mentioned in section \ref{NT} that asserts a particular membership of $BOOLEAN$. This lemma is first used in the proof of VC $vc501\_1$, but is also used many times over in subsequent VC proofs.

The lemmas in this section fall into 3 main groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Set Membership of Record Fields
\item
Enumeration Types
\item
Specific Record a Member of a Record Set
\end{itemize}
These groups are discussed below. In addition, there is one lemma about singleton sets that is application specific in the sense that it contains actual values which are relevant to the application specification:
=GFT
vc1501_1_lemma
µ y : ƒ; z : ƒ · 0 .. 2 ¸ {y}  0 .. 2 ­ z ¤ y  z
=TEX

\subsubsection{Set Membership of Record Fields}
The three lemmas:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$vc501\_lemma$
\item
$vc807\_lemma2$
\item
$vc901\_lemma$
\end{itemize}

are of the form
=INLINEFT
(STATE DISPLAY ACTIVE).field  set
=TEX
\ where the types of $STATE$, $DISPLAY$ and $ACTIVE$ are as in section \ref{OVER}. For example:
=GFT
vc501_lemma
ô µ s : ALARMSTATE; d : BASICTYPESoDISPLAYPOSITION; a : ALARMTYPE
    · (s d a).RAISED  BOOLEAN
=TEX
This result is used with $bool\_lemma1$ and $bool\_lemma2$, as described in section \ref{NT}, to provide results of the form
=INLINEFT
not X = TRUE ´ X = FALSE
=TEX

These set memberships arise from indexing into an array of records in SPARK.
\subsubsection{Enumeration Types}
The three lemmas:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$vc807\_lemma2$
\item
$vc807\_lemma3$
\item
$vc807\_lemma4$
\end{itemize}
provide results about the enumeration types $ALARMLEVEL$ and $ALARMRESET$. For example:
=GFT
vc807_lemma3;
val it = ô µ s : ALARMSTATE; d : BASICTYPESoDISPLAYPOSITION; a : ALARMTYPE
    · ³ (s d a).REOCCURS = RESET ´ (s d a).REOCCURS = NORESET : THM
=TEX
This result is needed when unwinding the definitions in the proof of $vc807\_3$.
\subsubsection{Record a Member of Record Set}
There are six lemmas in this group
\begin{itemize}
\item
$vc807\_lemma5$
\item
$vc807\_lemma6$
\item
$vc902\_lemma1$
\item
$vc902\_lemma2$
\item
$vc1101\_lemma$
\item
$vc120705\_lemma$
\end{itemize}

For example:
=GFT
vc807_lemma5
ô (LEVEL ¦ AUDIOVISUALFLASH, RAISED ¦ Boolean true,
        REOCCURS ¦ NORESET)
     ALARMDATA
=TEX
and
=GFT

These lemmas are used in conjunction with the override lemmas.   For example, in order to apply $«\_lemma4$ in the proof of $vc807\_1$, as described in  section \ref{OVER}, it is necessary to prove that the $z$, i.e.

The SPARK construct which gives rise to these forms is assignment to an array of records.

\section{DISCUSSION}\label{DISCUSSION}
The first point to note is that the proofs of the VCs were not particularly difficult --- for someone reasonably proficient in using {\Product} to do proofs in Z.
Many of the difficulties encountered would be ameliorated by improved documentation of the particular types of goal which the Compliance Tool tends to generate.


The proofs of the VCs do emphasise many of the points reported in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/WRK508,ISS/HAT/DAZ/WRK509}.
They also help to prioritise the recommendations given in those documents.

The general purpose lemmas discussed in section \ref{GENPUR} above are suggestive of classes of proof tools which could usefully be constructed.
In particular, the override lemmas highlight the need for help with the VCs which arise from array assignments, and the ``not TRUE'' lemmas show up some cases where SPARK booleans require special handling.
The lemmas about $intmod$ are perhaps less significant, in that they are necessary because of the specification style adopted rather than because of any general property of the Compliance Notation.
The ``singleton set'' lemmas suggest that some help with SPARK array aggregates would be useful.

The application specific lemmas discussed in section \ref{APPSPEC} above seem to emphasise the importance of SPARK typing in proving VCs.
Each of the three classes of lemma is, at heart, concerned with the fact that the translation into Z of a SPARK expression gives a Z expression which can usually be proved to be a member of the set denoted by the SPARK type of the original expression.

It is also noteworthy that many of the lemmas are designed for use with the forward chaining tactics.
E.g., the override lemmas are formulated in such a way that forward chaining will often automatically derive a desired result given the form of the assumptions and the lemma.
In such cases, a more automated proof procedure which worked backwards would be at a disadvantage if the user were required to state the desired result (since that can be quite a complicated formula).
It is conceivable that a useful interface to such a proof procedure would automatically identify those parts of the goal which it should attack.
For example, a tool to simplify SPARK boolean expressions might identify all the operands of SPARK boolean operators in the goal and then attempt to verify that these expressions are in the set $BOOLEAN$ (cf. the ``not TRUE'' lemmas in section \ref{NT} above).



\section{RECOMMENDATIONS} \label{RECOMMENDATIONS}
In addition to the specific tools identified in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/WRK508,ISS/HAT/DAZ/WRK509}, the work on the SHOLIS VCs highlights the following topics for further work:

\begin{enumerate}
\item documentation to help a user progress from the {\Product} Z tutorial material to proving Compliance Notation VCs.
\item interfaces to the proof tools mentioned in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/WRK508} to do with SPARK typing which save the user having to calculate the membership statement to be proved.
\item the prototype forward chaining tactics which handle bi-implications as equations rather than implications should be productised.
\end{enumerate}
