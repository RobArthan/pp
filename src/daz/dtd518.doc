\section{HOL TACTICS}\label{HT}

val €hc_rule› :	bool -> int -> (TERM list -> TERM) -> TERM list ->

=DESCRIBE
$hc\_rule$ is a Horn clause theorem prover. A call of $hc\_rule$, such as:
=GFT
	hc_rule diag limit sel hyps rules facts ¨tÆ
=TEX
either fails or returns a theorem
=INLINEFT
á Ù t
=TEX
\ where the assumptions $\Gamma$ are a subset of the terms in the list $hyps$.
The theorem is found by a backwards search using implicative facts (the Horn clauses) given by the $facts$ and $rules$ parameters in an attempt to eliminate the assumption of the theorem
=INLINEFT
t Ù t
=TEX
.
This search is carried out using the so-called SLD-resolution or pure-prolog algorithm.
This algorithm works by processing a set of theorems of the form
=INLINEFT
á Ù t
=TEX
; on each pass of the algorithm, each theorem in the set is examined in turn and the information provided in the paramters to $hc\_rule$ is used in an attempt to eliminate an assumption of the theorem.
In more detail the parameters of $hc\_rule$ are as follows:

\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{5.5in}|}\hline
$diag$ & if this is set $true$, a diagnostic trace of the resolution process is produced.
\\\hline
$limit$ & this gives an upper bound on the number of iterations of the resolution process to be attempted; the rule will abandon processing if the resolution process has not terminated after $limit$ iterations.
\\\hline
$sel$ & this function is used to select the next candidate assumption for elimination.
It must return some member of the (non-empty) list of terms passed as its parameter.
$hd$ is an adequate choice for $sel$ in simple applications.
\\\hline
$hyps$ & the resolution process terminates successfully when a theorem of the form
=INLINEFT
á Ù t
=TEX
\ has been found, all of whose assumptions, á, are contained (up to $\alpha$-convertibility) in the list $hyps$.
\\\hline
$rules$ & The $rules$ are used to provide information which is too general too express using theorems.
Each rule, when given an parameter $p$ say, should either fail or return a list of theorems of the form:
=INLINEFT
Râ1, ..., Râm Ù p'
=TEX
, where $p$ and $p'$ are unifiable.
Each theorem in the list is used to eliminate an assumption in much the same way as a theorem obtained from $facts$ by unification (see below).
\\\hline
$facts$ & The $facts$ have the general form:
=INLINEFT
µxâ1 .. xâk∑ Râ1 ± ... ± Râm ¥ R
=TEX
, where either $k$ or $m$ or both may be $0$.
The resolution process works by attempting to unify the succedents $R$ of these theorems with the assumption $p$, say, in a theorem of the form
=INLINEFT
p, Ñ Ù t
=TEX
. If the unification succeeds, the latter theorem is replaced by:
=INLINEFT
R'â1, ..., R'âm, Ñ' Ù t
=TEX
\ where the primes denote the result of carrying out the (type and term) substitution indicated by unification.
\\\hline
=INLINEFT
¨tÆ
=TEX
 & is the conclusion of the theorem to be proved.
\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{centering}

If either of the two possible failures listed below propagates to the top level, and if $diag$ is $false$, then the results of the last successful resolution pass are printed. (If $diag$ is $true$, these results will have already been printed out.)

These functions are intended to assist a tactic programmer in constructing the parameters required by $hc\_rule$ and $basic\_hc\_tac$, q.v.

=INLINEFT
hc_±_rule
=TEX

=INLINEFT
hc_≤_rule

$conv\_then\_hc\_rule$ and $hc\_rule\_of\_conv$ are also for use in constructing the $rules$ parameter.
$conv\_then\_hc\_rule\,conv\,rule$ is a rule which attempts to apply $conv$ to transform its parameter before applying $rule$ to the result.
$hc\_rule\_of\_conv\,conv$ is a rule which, given a term $t$ such that
=INLINEFT
conv¨tÆ
=TEX
\ is
=INLINEFT
Ù t = t'
=TEX
, returns a list containing the single theorem
=INLINEFT
t' Ù t
=TEX
.

$hc\_canon$ is for use in constructing the $thms$ parameter.
It performs the same canonicalisation as $fc\_canon1$, q.v., with the following two exceptions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The subterms of the form
=INLINEFT
≥p ¥ F
=TEX
\ introduced by $fc\_canon1$
are transformed into
=INLINEFT
p
=TEX
.
\item
Where $fc\_canon1\,th$ would return an empty list, $hc\_canon\,th$ will return the list $[th]$ (to serve as a ground clause in the Horn clause theorem prover).
\end{enumerate}

=DESCRIBE
$basic\_hc\_tac$ is a tactic based on the Horn clause prover $hc\_rule$.
In a typical call:
=GFT
		basic_hc_tac diag limit sel can rules thms
=TEX
the parameters $diag$, $limit$, $sel$, and $rules$ and are exactly as for $hc\_rule$, q.v.
The $facts$ parameter for $hc\_rule$ is computed by using the canonicalisation function $can$ to derive theorems from the assumptions of the goal and from  $thms$.
The $hyps$ parameter for $hc\_rule$ is the list of assumptions of the goal.
$hc\_rule$ is used with these parameter values in an attempt to prove the conclusion of the goal.

$hc\_tac$ is like $basic\_hc\_tac$ but using default values for all parameters but $thms$.
The defaults are to take $diag = false$, $sel = hd$ and $limit = 100$, and to derive $can$ and $rules$ using $hc\_canon$, q.v., and the current proof context.

\subsection{Propositional Simplification Etc.}
=DOC
val €cn_vc_simp_tac› : THM list -> TACTIC;
=DESCRIBE
This tactic performs simplifications which are often appropriate at the beginning of the proof of a VC goal generated by the Compliance Tool.
It should generally be used in the proof context $cn$ or $cn1$ or in some proof context incorporating one of these.
It attempts to carry out the following steps (and fails if none of them succeeds in changing the goal):

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Rewrite the conclusion of the goal with: the theorems supplied in the parameter (if any); the rewriting rules built into the current proof context; and, $z\_plus\_assoc\_thm$ and $z\_times\_assoc\_thm$.
\item
Remove any outer universal quantifiers (using $z\_µ\_tac$), typically leaving an implication whose operands are conjunctions.
\item
Remove any redundant conjuncts from the result of step 2.
At this stage, the goal will be proved automatically if the antecedents of the implication subsume the succedents.
\end{enumerate}

For example, using the proof context $cn1$, $cn\_vc\_simp\_tac$, will transform the goal:

=GFT
?Ù	µ	x : INTEGER; y : INTEGER; z : INTEGER
	|	(x + y) + 1 eq z = TRUE ± (x æ 0 ± y æ 0) ± x æ 0
	∑	x æ 0 ± z greater_eq 0 = TRUE
=TEX
into:
=GFT
?Ù		x ç INTEGER ± y ç INTEGER ± z ç INTEGER
	±	x + y + 1 = z ± 0 º x ± 0 º y
	¥	0 º z

	val €pc_z_ç_rules_of_thms› :	string list ->
					THM list -> (TERM * (TERM -> THM)) list;

=DESCRIBE
These are tools used to construct proof contexts for use in conjunction
with the tactic $cn\_hc_tac$.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Type-Membership Prover}
=DOC
	val €cn_ç_type_tac› : THM list -> TACTIC
=DESCRIBE
This is a tactic for proving assertions of the form
=INLINEFT
e ç T
=TEX
\ where $T$ is the representation in Z of a SPARK type and $e$ is the translation into Z of a SPARK expression.

The heuristic approach used by the tactic works best with the proof contexts that are generated by $cn\_make\_script\_support$.
It will also work with the proof context $cn1$ if only predefined SPARK types are involved.

The tactic uses the assumptions of the goal, together with any theorems supplied as an argument as ground facts in an attempt to reduce assertions of the form
=INLINEFT
e ç T
=TEX
\ according to the structure of $e$.
For example, an assertion of the form
=INLINEFT
f(x) ç T
=TEX
\ is reduced to the two assertions
=INLINEFT
f ç X ≠ T
=TEX
\ and
=INLINEFT
x ç X
=TEX
\ and, if the ground facts provide a suitable candidate for the variable $X$, then the original assertion is proved.

For example, given the SPARK declarations:

=GFT
     type ABC is (A, B, C);
     type BYTE is range 0 .. 255;
     type MARKED_BYTE is record B : BYTE; F : BOOLEAN; end record;
     type ARR is array (ABC) of MARKED_BYTE;
=TEX
=INLINEFT
cn_ç_type_tac
=TEX
\ will prove goals such as:

=GFT
	W ç ARR ; I ç ABC ?Ù (W I).B ç BYTE
=TEX

\section{TEST POLICY}

The module tests for this module are to follow the guidelines
identified in the quality plan~\cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/PLN003}.
There are no special testing considerations.

$cn\_ç\_type\_tac$ is tested in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/MDT517} as greater
test resources are available at that point.
