A frequent phenomenon in Z is that we have facts of the form:
=GFT
f ç X ≠ Y
x ç X
=TEX
and we need a theorem of the form:
=GFT
f x ç Y
=TEX
Such a theorem is easy enough to solve in simple cases by forward chaining.
However, in more complex examples forward chaining can produce too many irrelevant results and still fail to find what we're looking for.
In such cases the resolution theorem prover (i.e., the $prove\_tac$ in most proof contexts) will also tend to follow far too many blind alleys.
An approach which works backwards from the desired theorem has a good chance of being more successful.

A goal-directed approach which promises to have the right characteristics is the horn clause proof procedure used in the pure prolog execution model.
This approach uses a database of horn clauses, i.e., predicates of the form
=INLINEFT
µxâ1 .. xâk∑ Râ1 ± ... ± Râk ¥ R
=TEX
.
In what follows we will call the members of this database the {\em facts}.
The horn clauses are used to prove queries of the general form
=INLINEFT
∂yâ1 .. yâm∑ Q
=TEX
\ essentially by systematically searching for witnesses.
This search is carried out using a set, $S$, of intermediate queries.
At each stage in the search, $S$ will contain a set of predicates of the form
=INLINEFT
µzâ1 .. zâj∑ Qâ1 ± ... ± Qâj ¥ Q'
=TEX
\ where $Q'$ is an instance of $Q$ obtained by specialising zero or more of the existentially quantified variables
=INLINEFT
yâ1 .. yâk
=TEX
.
If some member of $S$ has $j = 0$, i.e. if the antecedent of one of the implications in $S$ becomes true, then we have found a true instance of $Q$, which provides witnesses to the truth of the original existentially quantified query.
The (non-deterministic) algorithm to carry out the search is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Set
=INLINEFT
S = {µâ1 .. yâm∑ Q ¥ Q}
=TEX
.
This makes the only member of $S$ a (universally quantified) tautology, which is certainly a consequence of the facts.
\item
Now make three choices:
{\em(i)} pick a member of $S$, say
=INLINEFT
µzâ1 .. zâa∑ Qâ1 ± ... ± Qâb ¥ Q'
=TEX
; {\em(ii)} pick a fact, say
=INLINEFT
µxâ1 .. xâk∑ Râ1 ± ... ± Râm ¥ R
=TEX
; {\em(iii)} pick some $Q_j$.
\item
Attempt to unify $Q_j$ and $R$.
If there is no unifier then go back to step 2.
\item
We now have a unifier for $Q_j$ and $R$.
Specialise the $R_i$, giving $R'_i$ say, using this unifier and replace $Q_j$ 
by
=INLINEFT
R'â1 ± ... ± R'âk
=TEX
.
\item
If $a = 1$ and $m = 0$, we are done, the element of $S$ made in the previous step is the desired instance of $Q$.
Otherwise go back to step 2.
\end{enumerate}

The following type is used for the implicative facts we use in the prolog-like search.
The implication
=INLINEFT
µx1 .. xk∑ R1 ± ... ± Rk ¥ R
=TEX
\ is represented as a theorem with assumptions:
=INLINEFT
R1, ..., Rk Ù R
=TEX
. The free variables of this theorem (including the $xi$) are remembered since they are needed when we do unification.

The same type is used for the queries we are trying to solve in the prolog-like search.
A query is represented as a theorem with assumptions:
=INLINEFT
Q1, ..., Qk Ù Q

The rule $asm\_spec\_rule$ is intended to meet the following requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$tysubs$ and $tmsubs$ are type and term substitutions which unify the conclusion of $thm$ with some term of interest $t$, say.
The theorem returned by $asm\_spec\_rule$ must have the same conclusion as would be obtained by instantiating the conclusion of $thm$ using these substitutions.
\item
The type and term variables given by the ``hyp'' parameters should not be renamed.
\item
$tysubs$ and $tmsubs$ are as returned by $term\_unify$; in particular, the  variables in the second components of the pairs in $tmsubs$ have the same types as in $thm$ --- they have not yet been instantiated according to $tysubs$.
\item
The theorem returned by $asm\_spec\_rule$ should be as general as possible as regards the names of type and term variables, subject to requirements 1 and 2.
\item
The type and term variables given by the ``avoid'' parameters should not appear in the resulting theorem, except where this is dictated by requirements 1 and 2.

The following functions uses a rule which given a term $tm$ is expected either to fail or to prove zero or more theorems of the form
=INLINEFT
Ñ Ù tm
=TEX
. Such a rule can be used in much the same way as a fact theorem.
In the following, we allow (as an exceptional case) for the theorem
to have the form
=INLINEFT
Ñ Ù tm'
=TEX
, where $tm'$ can be unified with $tm$ using $thm\_resolve$.
