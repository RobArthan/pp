\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document responds to the first recommendation of \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/WRK509}.

\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}

This document gives the detailed designs for tools that provide an easy user interface to the non-conjecture paragraphs generated by the  Compliance Notation Tool.

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
???

\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
See \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/WRK509}, for examples of what could be done if the requirement on not expanding the compliance notation constants was relaxed.

\section{DESIGN ISSUES}\label{DESIGNISSUES}

\subsection{Pure Tools}
These tools take as input a list of axioms and definitions (or just extracts them from a nominated theory or theories) and saves theorems that are the best rewrite theorems that
can be derived using knowledge of Compliance Notation forms, as discussed in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/WRK509}.
The theorems should be saved in the current theory (the user may wish to use $new\_theory$ first).
It should also bind all the derived theorems to ML value names, and produce one or more
ML bindings of lists of theorems (most importantly, all generated theorems).

This will not expand out the definitions of any Compliance Notation constants, even those linked by apparently being generated from the same
basic declaration.

The new theorems should be sufficient that the original axioms and definitions need no longer be used 
(this ability to hide the original items is the only reason for processing axioms, as the
only relevant axioms are of the form $name : type$ which has little processing that
can be done).

The names of these tools are all prefixed $pure\_cn\_$.

\subsection{Alternative Tools}
These tools follow the alternative categorisation of definitions in
\cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/WRK509}.

This was as folows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The definition is of a constant -- doesn't use other compliance notation definitions for simplification.
\item
The definition is of a kind of type attribute that is always a function
(e.g. the successor attribute). 
Such definitions will be presented as a conditional rewrite for the
application of the function.
This will use definitions for the type and its other attributes for simplification.
\item
The definition is of a kind of type attribute that is not always a function (e.g. scalar or a range) -- doesn't use other compliance notation definitions for simplification.
\item
The definition equates a type to a set abstraction of a standard form for the
Compliance Notation (e.g. cases 2 and 3 of subtypes).
Such definitions will be presented as defining the type equal to the intersection of a total function
and some pre-existing type, which may be more convenient for reasoning.
This will use definition of the master type for the subtype for simplification.
\item
The definition is of a type, but is some other form than one of the standard set abstraction forms -- doesn't use other compliance notation definitions for simplification.
\end{itemize}

The names of these tools are all prefixed $pure\_cn\_$.

\subsection{Preamble}

The following preamble creates the theory ``cn_theory_support'' as a child of ``z\_library''.

open_theory"cn";
push_pc "z_library";
delete_theory"cn_theory_support" handle Fail _ => ();

\section{THE STRUCTURE}\label{THESTRUCTURE}
\subsection{Preamble}
\subsection{Pure Tools}
=DOC
signature ÛCNTheoryProofSupportÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
This is the signature for the Theory Proof Support Tools.
=ENDDOC

=DOC
val Ûpure_cn_support_theoryÝ : string -> unit;
val Ûlist_pure_cn_support_theoryÝ : string list -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$pure\_cn\_support\_theory$ takes a theory name as argument.
Assuming the theory is in scope it will examine each of the definitions and
axioms in the theory.

For definitions, if they are of the form:
=GFT
name == RHS
=TEX
they will be processed as below, and likewise if an axiom is of the form:
=GFT
name : TYPE
=TEX
or
=GFT
[ name ]
=TEX
they will be processed as below.
Otherwise, any other forms of definition or axiom will be ignored.

The processing will attempt to save theorems of the form:
=GFT
ô name = RHS'
ô name  TYPE'
ô name  U
=TEX
respectively, where $RHS'$, $TYPE'$ may be $RHS$ and $TYPE$ or may be simplified versions.
The simplifications will be by reasoning about constructs from $z\_library$ or its ancestors.

The theorems will be saved in the current theory under the name $cts\_name\_thm$,
and will also be bound to an ML variable of the same name.
If the theorem name is already in use then it is assumed to be for an earlier
use of the support tool, and the theorem will be replaced, and a warning issued.

Finally, a list of the theorems generated will be bound to the ML name $cts\_theoryname\_thms$.

$list\_pure\_cn\_support\_theory$ acts like $pure\_cn\_support\_theory$ mapped over a list of theory names, except that duplicate names in the list will be ignored.

$pure\_cn\_support\_thm$

=ENDDOC

=DOC
val Ûpure_cn_support_thmsÝ : THM list -> string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$pure\_cn\_support\_thms$ takes a list of theorems and analyses those that are Z paragraphs as if by $pure\_cn\_support\_theory$,
except that it binds the list of created theorems to the ML name that is the function's second argument, failing before saving any theorems if that is not a valid ML name.
=FAILURE

517002	Cannot force the saving of theorem ?0 in theory ?1
517003	?0 is not a valid ML variable name
=ENDDOC

=DOC
val Ûpure_cn_support_thmÝ : THM -> string * THM;
=DESCRIBE
$pure\_cn\_support\_thm$ analyses its single theorem as if by $pure\_cn\_support\_theory$,
except that it does not save the resulting theorem, or bind it to an ML variable.
The function instead returns the name that $pure\_cn\_support\_theory$ would have used,
and the theorem it would have saved.
=FAILURE
517004	?0 is not capable of being supported
=ENDDOC

\subsection{Alternative Tools}
=DOC
val Ûcn_simplify_ruleÝ : THM -> THM;
=DESCRIBE
This does some Compliance Notation specific simplifications, if
the appropriate definitions are available:
=GFT
ô namevSUCC = (name \ {namevLAST} ) ò succ
	becomes 	
	ô µ i : int‰1 .. (name‰1 - 1) · namevSUCC i = i + 1
	where int‰1 is the first natural number of the range, and name‰1
	is the top expression of the range that name translates to.

ô namevPRED = namevSUCC ç~ê
	becomes 	
	ô µ i : int‰1 .. name‰2 · namevPRED i = i - 1
	where int‰1 is the second natural number of the range, and name‰1
	is the top expression of the range that name translates to.

ô namevPOS = id name
	becomes 	
	ô µ i : name · namevPOS i = i

ô namevVAL = namevPOS ç~ê
	becomes 	
	ô µ i : name · namevVAL i = i

ô name = {u : master | dom u = index}
	becomes 	
	ô name  (index ­ comp) ¡ master
=TEX
Precise following of naming conventions will not be required.

If no simplifications apply, or the theorem is in the wrong form,
 then the original argument is returned.
=ENDDOC

=DOC
val Ûcn_support_theoryÝ : string -> unit;
val Ûlist_cn_support_theoryÝ : string list -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$cn\_support\_theory$ acts as $pure\_cn\_support\_theory$, except that
the generic simplifications will be supplimented by some changes specific
to the compliance notation, provided by $cn\_simplify\_rule$.

The theorems will be saved in the current theory under the name $cts\_name\_thm$,
and will also be bound to an ML variable of the same name.
If the theorem name is already in use then it is assumed to be for an earlier
use of the support tool, and the theorem will be replaced, and a warning issued.

Finally, a list of the theorems generated will be bound to the ML name $cts_theoryname\_thms$.

$list\_cn\_support_theory$ acts like $cn\_support\_theory$ mapped over a list of theory nmes, except that duplicate names in the list will be ignored.
