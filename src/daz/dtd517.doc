\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document responds to the first and second recommendations of \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/WRK509}.
This is with the intent of fulfilling item 6 of \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/MIN009} v1.2.

\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}

This document gives the detailed designs for tools that provide an easy user interface to the non-conjecture paragraphs generated by the  Compliance Notation Tool.

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This relies on the presence of the compliance notation material that comes prior to it in the DAZ build of \Product.

\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
See \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/WRK509}.

Saving theorems in structures.

\section{DESIGN ISSUES}\label{DESIGNISSUES}

These tools follow the alternative categorisation of definitions in
\cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/WRK509}.

This was as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The definition is of a constant -- doesn't use other compliance notation definitions for simplification.
\item
The definition is of a kind of type attribute that is always a function
(e.g. the successor attribute). 
Such definitions will be presented as a conditional rewrite for the
application of the function.
This will use definitions for the type and its other attributes for simplification.
\item
The definition is of a kind of type attribute that is not always a function (e.g. scalar or a range) -- doesn't use other compliance notation definitions for simplification.
\item
The definition equates a type to a set abstraction of a standard form for the
Compliance Notation (e.g. cases 2 and 3 of subtypes).
Such definitions will be presented as defining the type equal to the intersection of a total function
and some pre-existing type, which may be more convenient for reasoning.
This will use definition of the master type for the subtype for simplification.
\item
The definition equates a type to a horizontal schema.
The horizontal schema will be ``flattened'' to have one variable introduced per 
SDECL in the signature, and the variable will be in a fixed order. 
\item
The definition is of a type, but is some other form than one of the standard set abstraction forms -- doesn't use other compliance notation definitions for simplification.
\end{itemize}

The names of these tools are all prefixed $cn\_$.

=IGN

The following preamble creates the theory ``cn_theory_support'' as a child of ``z\_library''.

=TEX
\section{RECOMMENDED MODE OF USE}
The normal user will use $all\_cn\_make\_script\_support$, to generate both the supporting theorems and the supporting proof context for their current
script.
\section{THE STRUCTURE}\label{THESTRUCTURE}
\subsection{Preamble}

=DOC
signature ÛCNTheoryProofSupportÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
This is the signature for the Theory Proof Support Tools.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Supporting Tools}
=DOC
val Ûz_norm_sig_h_schema_convÝ : CONV;
=DESCRIBE
Given an arbitrary horizontal schema, $ñ[ sig | body ]®$, this conversion will
return the theorem that states that the original horizontal schema is equal to one with
the signature variables placed in $z\_sig\_order$ in a list of declarations
(SDECLs) each with only a single variable.
E.g. 
=GFT
[x, z: X; y : Y; v, w :Z | (v, w, x, z, y, w)  p ]
will become
[ v : Z; w : Z; x : X; y : Y; z : X | (v, w, x, z, y, w)  p ]
=TEX
=FRULE 1 Conversion
z_norm_sig_h_schema_conv

and
=FRULE 1 Conversion
z_norm_sig_h_schema_conv

ô [ sig ] = [ sig' ]
=TEX
where $sig'$ is the normalised form of sig.
It is possible for this conversion to cause no change.
=FAILURE
517005	?0 is not a horizontal schema
=ENDDOC

=DOC
val Ûcn_simplify_canonÝ : THM -> THM list;
=DESCRIBE
This does some Compliance Notation-specific simplifications, if
the appropriate definitions are available.
In the following examples the likely constant name suffixes are used, but are not required by the canonicalisation function.
=GFT
ô namevSUCC = (name \ {namevLAST} ) ò succ
	becomes ô µ i : name‰1 .. name‰2 + ~ 1 · namevSUCC i = i + 1
	and ô namevSUCC  name‰1 .. (name‰2 + ~ 1) ­ name‰1 + 1 .. name‰2
	where name‰1 is the bottom, and name‰2 is the top expression of the
	range that is translated from name

ô namevPRED = namevSUCC ç~ê
	becomes ô µ i : name‰1 + 1 .. name‰2 · namevPRED i = i + ~ 1
	and ô namevPRED  name‰1 + 1 .. name‰2 ­ name‰1 .. (name‰2 + ~ 1)
	where name‰1 is the bottom, and name‰2 is the top expression of the
	range that is translated from name

ô namevPOS = id name
	becomes ô µ i : name · namevPOS i = i
	and ô namevPOS  name ­ name

ô namevVAL = namevPOS ç~ê
	becomes ô µ i : name · namevVAL i = i
	and ô namevVAL  name ­ name

ô name = {u : master | dom u = index}
	becomes ô name = (index ­ comp) ¡ master

ô name = [ sig ]
	becomes ô name = [ sig' ]
	where sig' is the normalised form of sig, via z_norm_sig_z_schema_conv

ô name = [ sig | pred ]
	becomes ô name = [ sig' | pred ]
	where sig' is the normalised form of sig, via z_norm_sig_z_schema_conv
=TEX
The canonicalisation may also do some limited simplification to theorems that
partially match the patterns given above.
If none of simplifications apply
then the canon returns the empty list.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Script Support Tools}
=DOC
val Ûcn_script_support_thmsÝ : string -> THM list;
val Ûlist_cn_script_support_thmsÝ : string list -> THM list;
=DESCRIBE
$cn\_script\_support\_thms$ takes a theory name as argument.
Assuming the theory is in scope it will examine each of the definitions and
axioms in the theory.

For definitions, if they are of the form:
=GFT
name == RHS
=TEX
they will be processed as below, and likewise if an axiom is of the form:
=GFT
name : TYPE
=TEX
or
=GFT
[ name ]
=TEX
they will be processed as below.
Any other forms of definition or axiom will be ignored.

Unless other simplifications apply, processing will attempt to save theorems of the form:
=GFT
ô name = RHS'
ô name  TYPE'
ô name = U
=TEX
respectively, where $RHS'$, $TYPE'$ may be $RHS$ and $TYPE$ or may be simplified versions.

These generic simplifications may be supplimented by some changes specific
to the compliance notation, provided by applying $cn\_simplify\_canon$ to the generic theorem of the above (which may return multiple theorems), as follows.

The first theorem, if any, returned by $cn\_simplify\_canon$ will be saved in the current theory under the name $cn\_name\_thm$;
the second theorem returned will be saved under the name $cn\_name\_ty\_thm$;
and if it returns no theorems then the generic form of the theorem will be saved in the current theory under the name $cn\_name\_thm$.
Saved theorems will also be bound to an ML variable of the same name.
If a theorem is already saved in the current theory with the chosen theorem name then it is assumed to be for an earlier
use of the support tool, and the theorem will be replaced, and a warning issued.

Finally, a list of the theorems generated will be returned by the function.

$list\_cn\_script\_support\_thms$ acts like $cn\_script\_support\_thms$ mapped over a list of theory names, except that duplicate names in the list will be ignored.

=DOC
val Ûlist_cn_spec_ruleÝ : THM list -> THM list;
=DESCRIBE
$cn\_support\_thms$ takes a list of theorems and analyses those that are Z paragraphs as if by $cn\_script\_support\_thms$,
saving and returning the list of created theorems.

Note that in particular this means that the function can be applied to the results of $get\_spec$, but not those of $z\_get\_spec$.

	support theorem
517002	Cannot force the saving of theorem ?0 in theory ?1
517003	?0 is not a valid ML variable name
=ENDDOC

=DOC
val Ûcn_spec_ruleÝ : THM -> (string * THM) list;
=DESCRIBE
$cn\_support\_thm$ analyses its single theorem as if by $cn\_script\_support\_thms$,
except that it does not save the resulting theorem, or bind it to an ML variable.
The function instead returns the name or names that $cn\_script\_support\_thms$ would have used,
and the theorem or theorems it would have saved, except that
unchanged theorems will result in an empty list being returned.
=ENDDOC

=DOC
val Ûcn_make_script_supportÝ : string -> string -> THM list;
val Ûlist_cn_make_script_supportÝ : string list -> string -> THM list;
=DESCRIBE
$cn\_make\_script\_support$ $thyn$ $pcname$ 
will first attempt to act as $cn\_script\_support\_thms$ $thyn$, and will then 
create (overwriting previous versions) a complete proof context called $pcname$.
As with $cn\_make\_script\_support$, it returns the list of theorems generated.

$list\_cn\_make\_script\_support$  $thynames$ $pcname$ will first attempt to act as $list\_cn\_script\_support\_thms$ $thynames$, and will then 
create (overwriting previous versions) a complete proof context called $pcname$.

The proof context created will be ``cn1'' extended by:
\paragraph{Contents}
Rewriting: all saved support theorems (except equations with U);

Stripping theorems: bi-implications from support theorems, plus support theorem equations of sets promoted to biimplications of 
memberships (except where U elimation will apply).

Stripping conclusions:  as stripping conclusions.

Rewriting canonicalisation: no change;

Automatic proof procedures: no change.

Existence prover: no change.

The U simplification material will be extended by appending to the equation context the one formed from the equations of the form $nm = U$, via $set\_u\_simp\_eqn\_cxt$.

\paragraph{Usage Notes}
It requires its creation theory and theory $thyname$ to be in scope.
It is not intended to be mixed with HOL proof contexts.

=FAILURE
517001	Theorem ?0 in theory ?1 has been replaced by a new Compliance Notation
	support theorem
517002	Cannot force the saving of theorem ?0 in theory ?1
=ENDDOC

=DOC
val Ûall_cn_make_script_supportÝ : string -> THM list;
=DESCRIBE
$all\_cn\_make\_script\_support$ $pcname$ will determine all the theories that 
are parents of the current one, including ``cn'', but that are not also ancestors of ``cn'',
and will execute $list\_cn\_make\_script\_support$ on this list.

That is, this will create supporting theorems and a proof context based on all the in scope Compliance Notation packages.
