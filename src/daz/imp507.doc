\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
The detailed design for this material is in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD507}.
\subsection{Introduction}
Sections \ref{BASICDECLARATIONS} to \ref{WEBCLAUSES} implement the material defined in the corresponding sections of \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD507}. Section \ref{PREAMBLE} contains various material which supports this, e.g. the component update functions and initial environment values of \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD513}. Because the implementations of the component update functions are rather long-winded, they are all given together and the other material is not interleaved with them.
\subsection{Purpose and Background}
See \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD507}.
=TEX
\section{PREAMBLE AND AUXILIARIES}\label{PREAMBLE}
=SML
structure €CNZGenerator› : CNZGenerator = struct
=SML
open CNTypes CNTypes1 CNTypes2 CNBasicDeclsAndExprs ZParagraphs ZTermGenerator
	CNVCGenerator ZUserInterfaceSupport TypeInference CNParser
	ZTypesAndTermsSupport;
=TEX
The following function returns the current level for the specified theory.  This is used as an index to order objects being added to the theory.

=SML
val €current_level› : unit -> int =
	(#current_level o #contents o get_theory_info o
		get_current_theory_name);
=TEX
The following are the agreed tags for use in forming script names based on compilation unit names.
=SML
val €pack_spec_tag› : string = "'spec";
val €pack_body_tag› : string = "'body";
val €fun_tag› : string = "'func";
val €proc_tag› : string = "'proc";
val €stub_tag› : string = "'stub";
=TEX
The following functions are used to identify names for web clauses, in the naming of VCs and to form script names.
=SML
fun €k_slot_name› ({content, label} : K_SLOT) : string = "kslot"^label;
=TEX
=SML
fun €package_declaration_name›
	({name, ...} : DECLARATION PACKAGE_DECLARATION)
	: string * string = (
	(name, pack_spec_tag)
);
=TEX
=SML
fun €procedure_specification_name›
	({name, ...} : PROCEDURE_SPECIFICATION) : string = (
	name
);
=TEX
=SML
 fun €function_specification_name›
	({designator, ...} : FUNCTION_SPECIFICATION) : string = (
	designator
);
=TEX
=SML
fun €procedure_body_name› ({procedure_spec, ...} : PROCEDURE_BODY)
	: string = (
	procedure_specification_name procedure_spec
);
=TEX
=SML
fun €function_body_name› ({function_spec,...} :  FUNCTION_BODY)
	: string = (
	function_specification_name function_spec
);
=TEX
=SML
fun €package_body_name› ({name, ...} : PACKAGE_BODY) : string = (
	name
);
=TEX
The {\it in\_z} flag on those functions that have it below allows them to be reused
to calculate indexes into the package and subunit environments.
=SML
fun €proper_body_name› (pb : PROPER_BODY)
	: string * string = (
	case pb of
		PBProcedure prc => (procedure_body_name prc, proc_tag)
	|	PBFunction fnc =>  (function_body_name fnc, fun_tag)
	|	PBPackage pck => (package_body_name pck, pack_body_tag)
);
=TEX
=SML
fun €subunit_name› ({name, proper_body} : COMP_SUBUNIT)
	: string * string = (
	let	val (body_name, tag) = proper_body_name proper_body;
	in	(prefix_trans_id name body_name, tag)
	end
);
fun €compilation_unit_name› (cu : COMPILATION_UNIT)
	: string * string = (
	case cu of
		CUPackageDeclaration d => package_declaration_name d
	|	CUProperBody b => proper_body_name b
	|	CUSubUnit s => subunit_name s
);
=TEX
The following are used to set the bottom block name that may occasionally occur in VC names.
The name does not get the tag.
=SML
fun €context_compilation_unit_name›
	({comp_unit, ...} : CONTEXT_COMPILATION_UNIT) : string = (
	fst(compilation_unit_name comp_unit)
);
=TEX
=SML
fun €kslot_compilation_unit_name› (kcu : KSLOT_COMPILATION_UNIT) : string = (
	case kcu of
		KCUKSlot ks => k_slot_name ks
	|	KCUUnit ccu => context_compilation_unit_name ccu
	|	KCUPragma ccu => "<pragma>"
);
=TEX
\subsection{Making Z Predicates}
In some places, we need to form the HOL term corresponding to a Z predicate.
This may require coercion of a schema into a predicate:
=SML
fun €z_pred_of_z_tm› (env : CN_ENV)  (zt : Z_TM) : Z_PRED = (
	case zt of
		ZTmQuotation (tm, _) => tm
	|	_ =>
	let	val tm = z_predexp_of_z_tm env zt;
	in	if	type_of tm =: BOOL
		then	tm
		else	mk_z_schema_pred (tm, "")
	end
);
=TEX
The following function is used here and elsewhere to find the HOL name corresponding to a Z one.
=SML
val €hol_const_name› : Z_ID -> string = bind_gvar_name;
=TEX
\subsection{Initial Values}
=SML
val €pack_env0› : PACK_ENV = initial_s_dict;
val €subunit_env0› : SUBUNIT_ENV = initial_s_dict;
val €dec_env0› : DEC_ENV = initial_s_dict;
val €spec_env0› : SPEC_ENV = initial_s_dict;
=TEX
$empty\_block$ is the initial value for a block, as loosely specified in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD513}.
Fields which are not specified there are given place-holder values.
All the flags are set false, for convenience in defining $env0$.
It is convenient to define some shared dummy values first:
=SML
val €dummy_spec› : SPEC = {
		w 		= 	[],
		w0		=	[],
		pre		=	ZUserInterfaceSupport.ZTmTruth true,
		post		=	ZUserInterfaceSupport.ZTmTruth true};
val €dummy_informal_fun› : INFORMAL_FUN = {
		name		=	"*dummy fun*",
		formal_pars	=	[],
		par_names_defs	=	[],
		return_type	=	"*dummy type*"};
val €dummy_formal_fun› : FORMAL_FUN = {
		informal_fun	=	dummy_informal_fun,
		spec		=	dummy_spec,
		globals		=	[],
		renames		=	Nil};
val €dummy_formal_proc› : FORMAL_PROC = {
		name		=	"*dummy formal proc*",
		formal_ids	=	[],
		par_names_defs	=	[],
		spec		=	dummy_spec,
		globals		=	[]};
val €empty_in_scope› : IN_SCOPE = {
		dict		=	initial_env_dict,
		dec_labels	=	[]};
val €false_flags› : FLAGS = {
		pack_spec_flag		=	false,
		pack_body_flag		=	false,
		stub_flag		=	false,
		subunit_flag		=	false,
		formal_body_flag	=	false,
		fun_flag		=	false,
		declabel_flag		=	false,
		speclabel_flag		=	false,
		till_flag		=	false,
		body_flag		=	false};
val €dummy_declab› : DECLAB = {
		block_name	=	[],
		flags		=	false_flags,
		using_decs	=	[],
		in_scope	=	empty_in_scope};
=TEX
=SML
val €empty_block› : BLOCK = 	{
	declab		=	dummy_declab,
	current_formal_proc = dummy_formal_proc,
	current_formal_fun = dummy_formal_fun,
	current_for_vars = [],
	current_log_cons = [],
	current_loop_name = Nil,
	dec_lab = "",
	spec_lab = "",
	till = mk_z_true,
	var_inits = []
};
=TEX
Now we can define $env0$, exploiting the fact that all the flags are set to $false$ in $empty\_block$.
=SML
val €env0› : ENV = [empty_block];
=TEX
We also require initial values for the SPARK program and replacement environments discussed in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD513}
=SML
val €repl_env0› : REPL_ENV = initial_s_dict;
val €spark_prog0› : SPARK_PROG = [];
=TEX
For uniformity, we give the initial value for the theory name and deletion
information components of the global state here.
We use the string ``-'' for the script name which by convention in {\Product} means the current theory.

\subsection{The Global State}
For convenience in the implementation, the eight components of the state are held in eight assignable variables.
=SML

The global state may be set from a given value of type $CN\_STATE$ using the following function:

\subsection{Component Update Functions}
We give various update functions that are not mentioned in the
specification, as well as the ones called for.
Some of the ones required by the spec are introduced later on to get the dictionary handling right.

The following refines the specification by providing the ability to extend the existing dictionary rather than just replacing it.
If the optional first argument is non-nil, its value with the list of new variables entered into it replaces the dictionary.
If the optional first argument is nil, the new variables are entered into the existing dictionary.

To help with processing record types the following function takes a type definition and
for a record type returns the appropriate entity info giving the component names in order and the number of discriminants.

For other sorts of Ada type we need only record the fact that the Z global variable represents an Ada type.

\subsection{Accessing the Running Environment}
The function $block$ below implements the 1-based indexing of the running environment which is such a common feature of the Z spec.
=SML
fun €block› (index : int) : BLOCK = (
	(nth (index - 1) (!blocks))
	handle Fail _ => error "block" 507006 []
); 
=TEX
The following function is convenient for accessing the flags in the running environment.
The first parameter is the functions to extract the flag value: it will always be one of the ML built-in selection functions, $\#pack\_spec\_flag$ etc.
The second parameter gives the block to get the flag from: with $1$ identifying the topmost block.
=SML
fun €test_flag› (selector : FLAGS -> bool) (index : int) : bool = (
	(selector o #flags o #declab o block) index
);
=TEX
The specification does not specify the block name to be used in the bottom block in the running environment.
It is convenient to use this to tell the code which stores VCs the name of the current web clause.
The following two functions assist in this.
=SML
fun €set_bottom_block_name› (n : ID) : unit = (
	let	fun aux [] = [block_block_name(empty_block, [n])]

\subsection{$flatten\_env$}
To implement $flatten\_env$, we first need the function to combine two $IN\_SCOPE$s.
Since the environment dictionaries in the top-most block of the running environment includes the information from all lower blocks, we have only to collect together the declaration labels: the dictionary is just taken from the second block, which is expected to be the upper one.

To restrict the scope of frame widening, the block names are also passed in and $dec\_labels$ are not taken from the second $IN\_SCOPE$ when the two block names are different.

The treatment of the using declarations is the obvious one, but this is not relevant in the current usage of this function.
=SML
fun €merge_declabs›
	(block_name1 : ID list)
	({	dict=dict1,
		dec_labels = dec_labels1} : IN_SCOPE)
	(block_name2 : ID list)
	({	dict = _,
		dec_labels = dec_labels2} : IN_SCOPE) : IN_SCOPE = (
	{	dict = dict1,
		dec_labels =
		if block_name1 = block_name2
		then dec_labels1 cup dec_labels2
		else dec_labels1
	}
);
=TEX
We also need a function to extract the name and global dependency list of
the current formal subprogram:
=SML
fun €subprog_info› (block : BLOCK) : ID * Z_ID list= (
	if	#fun_flag (#flags (#declab block))
	then	let	val formal_fun = #current_formal_fun block;
		in	(#name (#informal_fun(formal_fun)), #globals formal_fun)
		end
	else	let	val formal_proc = #current_formal_proc block;
		in	(#name formal_proc, #globals formal_proc)
		end
);
=TEX
Now we define $flatten\_env$, which uses $merge\_in\_scopes$ to merge all the $in\_scope$ components of the blocks in a running environment.

=SML
fun €flatten_env› ([] : ENV) : IN_SCOPE = (
	empty_in_scope
) |  flatten_env [blk] = (
	#in_scope(#declab blk)
) |  flatten_env (blk1 :: (blks as (blk2 :: _))) = (
	merge_declabs
	(#block_name (#declab blk1))
	(#in_scope (#declab blk1))
	(#block_name  (#declab blk2))
	(flatten_env blks)
);
=TEX
Now we define $subprog\_flatten\_env$: the $filter\_XXX$ functions implement
the set comprehensions in the specification, with $filter_env$ fitting
the results together into an $IN\_SCOPE$.
=TEX
=SML
fun €expand_schema_sigs› (ns : Z_ID list) : Z_ID list = (
	let	fun aux n = (
			((map fst o dest_z_schema_type o dest_z_power_type o
			force_value o get_const_type) (hol_const_name n))
			handle Fail _ => [n]
		);
	in	flat (map aux ns)
	end
);
=SML
fun €subprog_flatten_env› ([] : ENV) : IN_SCOPE = (
	empty_in_scope
) |  subprog_flatten_env (blocks : ENV) = (
	let	val block1 = hd blocks;
		val flags = #flags (#declab block1);
	in	if	not(#formal_body_flag flags)
		then	flatten_env blocks
		else	let	val (name, globals1) = subprog_info block1;
				fun aux1 acc (b::bs:ENV) = (
					if simple_name(#block_name(#declab b)) <> name
					then rev acc
					else aux1 (b::acc) bs
				) | aux1 acc [] = rev acc;
				fun aux2 acc (b::bs:ENV) = (
					if simple_name(#block_name(#declab b)) = name
					then aux1 (b::acc) bs
					else aux2 (b::acc) bs
				) | aux2 acc [] = rev acc;
				val blocks2 = aux2 [] blocks;
				val {dict, dec_labels} = flatten_env blocks2;

\subsection{Theory User Data}
The so-called user data part of a ProofPower theory is used to hold various information about the literate scripts which have been or are being processed.
We collect together here those parts of the code concerned with this which do not depend on later material.

The following are the user data key reserved for the Compliance Tool.
=SML

The following functions to open out theory user data
are used in several places;
callers must handle the exception they can raise.

=SML
fun €dest_ud_string› (UD_String (n, uds)) = (n, uds)
|   dest_ud_string _ = fail "" 0 [] (* Caller MUST catch this *);
=TEX
=SML
fun €dest_ud_int› (UD_Int (n, uds)) = (n, uds)

=TEX

The following function updates the user data for the current theory.  Given a user data key and an item of data it retrieves any data currently stored under that key, adds the new data to it and then stores the result under the key.

=SML
fun €update_user_datum› (key : string) (xs : USER_DATUM) =
let
    val old_datum = (snd o dest_ud_string o get_user_datum "-")
					key handle Fail _ => [];
    val new_datum = xs::old_datum;
in
    set_user_datum(key, UD_String ("",new_datum))
end;
=TEX
The following sets a user data flag to indicate that the theory
was created by the compliance notation tool (e.g. by $new\_script$,
or perhaps as a stub or other supporting theory).
=SML
fun €set_cn_created› () : unit = (
	set_user_datum (cn_created_ud_key, UD_String("CN created",[]))
);
=TEX
And the following checks for the flag:
=SML
fun €get_cn_created› (thy : string) : bool = (
	(get_user_datum thy cn_created_ud_key; true) 
	handle (Fail _) => false
);
=TEX

The following functions are used to maintain the list of theories ``belonging'' to the current literate script.
=SML
fun €get_script_theories› (thy : string) : string list = (

The following should be used when about to add material for
a compilation unit to a theory. 
It raised a failure if a different compilation unit has already used the theory.
This function implements check 17.
The name is stored for the purposes of this check and to use
in the error message.
=SML
fun €set_compilation_unit› (cu_name: string, tag : string) : unit = (
let	val dummy = if (get_cn_created "-")

	val (was, _) = dest_ud_string(get_user_datum "-"

			handle Fail _ => ("" ,[]);
	val exp_thyn = cu_name ^ tag;
	val act_thyn = get_current_theory_name ();

end);
=TEX
The following is necessary when the key has been set incorrectly.
In particular, $duplicate\_theory$ copies keys, which is not helpful
in this case.
To support script deletion, we remember the name of the theory in which the stub which
gave rise to the duplicate came from.
=SML
fun €set_duplicate_keys› (cu_name: string, stub_script_name) : unit = (

The following functions are used to maintain the list of library theories ``belonging'' to the current literate script.
=SML
fun €get_library_theories› (thy : string) : string list = (

	(fn () => update_user_datum cn_script_library_theories_ud_key
			(UD_String(thy, []))) ()
);
=TEX

The next function adds a new parent to the current theory, and makes an entry of this fact in the current theory's user data.
If $allow\_fail$ is true, the function will not raise $Fail$: if the attempt to add the parent fails then the exception is caught and the error message is output as part of a comment.
=SML
fun €new_parent_aux› (allow_fail : bool) (thy : string) : unit = (
	if	not (thy mem get_parents "-")
	then	(	new_parent thy;

=TEX
The following function creates a new theory (with a given list of theories to be made parents in addition to the current theory) and tries to make sure
it has the current cache theory in its ancestry. This circumvents
a misfeature in versions of ProofPower up to and including 0.5.
=SML

The following is used to add the typing context for a parameter list into the context temporarily. It returns the context which should be restored when the parameters are no longer needed.
In order to reuse earler code for handling the parameter specifications, we need to process
them using an IN\_SCOPE that contains all the type marks that may appear in them.
However, we don't want to flatten out the resulting type inference context, but only to add the entries for the parameters into it (if this is done in a context where the Z types are out of scope, caller is doomed in any case).
Hence we build a new efficient context for the parameters (and anything else that it's in the running environment) and then look the parameters up in it and add them to the new context that we are going to set up.

 Then we shall need to find the origin of a 
VC from its name and form an abbreviated abstract syntax tree from the true abstract syntax
of the clause and the recorded walk. We do this in a depth first left to right walk of the 
tree in synchrony with a walk along the route. 

Our unit of database atomicity is the web clause, so we can add one context and any number
of origins and then put the data back again.

For various reasons, the underlying {\Product} operations of adding a new parent or saving a conjecture (e.g., a VC) do not increment the level counter.
In order for the Z document generator to be able to output the necessary commands in the right place, we step the current level before storing a VC.

=SML
fun €store_vcs› (opt_lab : LABEL OPT, vcs: TERM list, osl : SPECLAB OPT, 
		routes : ROUTE OPT list, vcg_ctxt : VC_GEN_CONTEXT ) 					: unit = (

=TEX
The processing of declarations can give rise to VCs.
These are delivered as conjecture paragraphs.
In order to handle these vcs uniformly with other VCs, we use
the following interface to the function for storing Z paragraphs.
Currently VCs cannot be generic, and so the interface below does not cater for generic VCs.
=SML
fun €store_para› (para : PARAINFO) : unit = (
	case para of

	) |	_ => update_theory_db_with_parainfo para
);
=TEX
The following attempts to store a paragraph, and then tidies everything
away again.
$delete\_top\_theory\_past\_level$ is taken verbatim from
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD049}.
This is used when a function (formal or informal) is encountered in a package specification to check that
the function name does not clash with an existing Z global variable and, for a formal function, to
ensure that the pre- and post-conditions are well-typed. As currently coded, the function
would not check that a conjecture has no free variables, but that check is not required in the
current usage.
=SML
fun €test_store_para›  (para : PARAINFO) : unit = (
	let	val cl = current_level();

The following creates a term formed from the variable initialisations and
the domain conditions for the initialising expressions
and combines it with a possible pre-existing pre-condition,
and returns a $Z\_TM$, as that is what a $SPEC$ wants.

It puts the list in the same order as it was before the introduction of
domain conditions).

\section{STATEMENTS}\label{STATEMENTS}
\subsection{Support for Processing Specification Statement}
The code that follows is essentially the implementation of {\it vc\_speclabel}
with an option not to store the generated VCs. This facility is used to
make checks on a specification statement (as statement) as soon as it is encountered
rather than waiting until someone tries to refine it (which they may never do).

The code does not follow the specification in fishing the label out of the environment
but takes it from the argument (which will have the same value in the call that actually
generates VCs and can be chosen by caller in the call that just makes checks).
The speclab is augmented by any variables brought into scope by a for-loop.

The first parameter of the following gives the name of the new declarative region, if any, e.g., a subprogram name.
The block name is obtained by appending the supplied name to the name of the enclosing block.
A {\em Nil} value corresponds to an unnamed declarative region, e.g., an unnamed loop.
As a special case, if then name is given as an empty string, the block name in the top block is used as is.
The bottom block name is always treated as empty here.

\subsection{Support for Functions in the Environment Dictionaries}
As for constant and type declarations, we need to keep the environment dictionaries up-to-date by mimicking for function the process for variables and procedures of going through the environments that my need updating to reflect the new declaration.

This is analogous to {\it update\_envs\_proc}, but as we need to distinguish formal and informal functions, it is called from the appropriate SID functions rather than as a SID function.

\subsection{The SID function renames\_object}
The implementation organises the logic a little differently from the specification but with the
same effect. It checks whether the renaming is a constant renaming simply by trying to
store the relevant abbreviation definition in the current theory (using {\it bd\_store\_para} so that
if the object renaming simply duplicates an earlier one it is accepted). This is guaranteed to
fail if the renaming is a legal variable renaming. If it succeeds, then we're done, otherwise
we do the appropriate work for variable renaming. Thus {\it renames\_object\_common}
below does the work of both {\it renames\_var\_common} and {\it renames\_const}, hence
the change of name. Likewise for {\it renames\_object\_pack\_spec}.

The following reflects the SID functions for $statement$ (see also $loop\_statement$ and $loop\_parameter\_specification$.

To have the same order of invocation of the SID functions for for- and while- loop statements as in the specification, it is necessary to ``expand in line'' the processing for their constituent loops.

Note that the parser is not expected to produce the {\it SSpecIvars}, {\it SProcIvars} or {\it SForNonStatic} alternatives, since it cannot carry out the necessary analysis of free variables.
It uses the no-initial-variables or static forms to carry the information
on, since these forms are adequately general.
The $STATEMENT$ alternatives are produced where necessary in the VC generator.
