\subsection{Changes Forecast}

\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
The detailed design for this material is in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD507}.
\subsection{Introduction}
Sections \ref{BASICDECLARATIONS} to \ref{WEBCLAUSES} implement the material defined in the corresponding sections of \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD507}. Section \ref{PREAMBLE} contains various material which supports this, e.g. the component update functions and initial environment values of \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD513}. Because the implementations of the component update functions are rather long-winded, they are all given together and the other material is not interleaved with them.
\subsection{Purpose and Background}
See \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD507}.
=TEX
\section{PREAMBLE AND AUXILIARIES}\label{PREAMBLE}
=SML
structure €CNZGenerator› : CNZGenerator = struct
=SML
open CNTypes CNTypes1 CNTypes2 CNBasicDeclsAndExprs ZParagraphs ZTermGenerator
	CNVCGenerator ZUserInterfaceSupport TypeInference CNParser
	ZTypesAndTermsSupport;
=TEX
The following function returns the current level for the specified theory.  This is used as an index to order objects being added to the theory.

=SML
val €current_level› : unit -> int =
	(#current_level o #contents o icl'Kernel.icl'get_theory_info o
		get_current_theory_name);
=TEX

The following functions are used to identify names for web clauses and are used in the naming of VCs.

=SML
fun €k_slot_name› ({content, label} : K_SLOT) : string = "kslot"^label;
fun €package_declaration_name›
	(in_z : bool)
	({name, ...} : DECLARATION PACKAGE_DECLARATION)
	: string = (
	if in_z then name ^ "spec" else name
);
fun €procedure_specification_name›
	({name, ...} : PROCEDURE_SPECIFICATION) : string = (
	name
);
 fun €function_specification_name›
	({designator, ...} : FUNCTION_SPECIFICATION) : string = (
	designator
);

fun €procedure_body_name› ({procedure_spec, ...} : PROCEDURE_BODY)
	: string = (
	procedure_specification_name procedure_spec
);
fun €function_body_name› ({function_spec,...} :  FUNCTION_BODY)
	: string = (
	function_specification_name function_spec
);
fun €package_body_name› (in_z : bool) ({name, ...} : PACKAGE_BODY) : string = (
	if in_z then name ^ "body" else name
);
=TEX
The {\it in\_z} flag on those functions that have it below allows them to be reused
to calculate indexes into the package and subunit environments.
=SML
fun €proper_body_name›(in_z : bool)  (pb : PROPER_BODY) : string = (
	case pb of
		PBProcedure prc => procedure_body_name prc
	|	PBFunction fnc =>  function_body_name fnc
	|	PBPackage pck => package_body_name in_z pck
);
fun €subunit_name› (in_z : bool) ({name, proper_body} : COMP_SUBUNIT) : string = (
	if	in_z
	then	name ^ "o" ^ proper_body_name in_z proper_body
	else	name ^ "." ^ proper_body_name in_z proper_body
);
fun €compilation_unit_name› (in_z : bool) (cu : COMPILATION_UNIT) : string = (
	case cu of
		CUPackageDeclaration d => package_declaration_name in_z d
	|	CUProperBody b => proper_body_name in_z b
	|	CUSubUnit s => subunit_name in_z s
);

fun €context_compilation_unit_name›
	({comp_unit, ...} : CONTEXT_COMPILATION_UNIT) = (
	compilation_unit_name true comp_unit
);
fun €kslot_compilation_unit_name› (kcu : KSLOT_COMPILATION_UNIT) : string = (
	case kcu of
		KCUKSlot ks => k_slot_name ks
	|	KCUUnit ccu => context_compilation_unit_name ccu
	|	KCUPragma ccu => "<pragma>"
);
=TEX
\subsection{Making Z Predicates}
In some places, we need to form the HOL term corresponding to a Z predicate.
This may require coercion of a schema into a predicate:
=SML
fun €z_pred_of_z_tm› (env : CN_ENV)  (zt : Z_TM) : Z_PRED = (
	let	val tm = z_predexp_of_z_tm1 env zt;
	in	if	type_of tm =: BOOL
		then	tm
		else	mk_z_schema_pred (tm, "")
	end
);
=TEX
\subsection{Component Update Functions}
We give various update functions that are not mentioned in the
specification, as well as the ones called for.
Some of the ones required by the spec are introduced later on to get the dictionary handling right.
=TEX
=SML

$empty\_block$ is the initial value for a block, as loosely specified in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD513}.
Fields which are not specified there are given place-holder values.
All the flags are set false, for convenience in defining $env0$.
It is convenient to define some shared dummy values first:
=SML

Now we can define $env0$, exploiting the fact that all the flags are set to $false$ in $empty\_block$.
=SML
val €env0› : ENV = [empty_block];
=TEX
We also require initial values for the SPARK program and replacement environments discussed in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD513}
=SML
val €repl_env0› : REPL_ENV = initial_s_dict;
val €spark_prog0› : SPARK_PROG = [];
=TEX
For uniformity, we give the initial value for the theory name and deletion
information components of the global state here.
We use the string ``-'' for the script name which by convention in {\Product} means the current theory.
=SML
val €script_name0› : string = "-";
val €deletion_info0› : SUBUNIT_ENV = [];
=TEX
=SML
val €init_z_generator_state› : Z_GENERATOR_STATE = (
	 {	pack_env = pack_env0,
		subunit_env = subunit_env0,
		dec_env = dec_env0,
		spec_env = spec_env0,
		blocks = env0,
		repl_env = repl_env0,
		spark_prog = spark_prog0,
		script_name = script_name0,
		deletion_info = deletion_info0}
);
=TEX
\subsection{$flatten\_env$}
To implement $flatten\_env$, we first need the function to combine two $IN\_SCOPE$s.
SInce the environment dictionaries in the top-most block of the running environment includes the information from all lower blocks, we have only to collect together the declaration labels: the dictionary is just taken from the second block, which is expected to be the upper one.

To restrict the scope of frame widening, the block names are also passed in and $dec\_labels$ are not taken from the second $IN\_SCOPE$ when the two block names are different.

The treatment of the using declarations is the obvious one, but this is not relevant in the current usage of this function.
=SML
fun €merge_declabs›
	(block_name1 : ID)
	({	dict=dict1,
		dec_labels = dec_labels1} : IN_SCOPE)
	(block_name2 : ID)
	({	dict = _,
		dec_labels = dec_labels2} : IN_SCOPE) : IN_SCOPE = (
	{	dict = dict1,
		dec_labels =
		if block_name1 = block_name2
		then dec_labels1 cup dec_labels2
		else dec_labels1
	}
);
=TEX
We also need a function to extract the name and global dependency list of
the current formal subprogram:
=SML
fun €subprog_info› (block : BLOCK) : ID * Z_ID list= (
	if	#fun_flag (#flags (#declab block))
	then	let	val formal_fun = #current_formal_fun block;
		in	(#name (#informal_fun(formal_fun)), #globals formal_fun)
		end
	else	let	val formal_proc = #current_formal_proc block;
		in	(#name formal_proc, #globals formal_proc)
		end
);
=TEX
Now we define $flatten\_env$, which uses $merge\_in\_scopes$ to merge all the $in\_scope$ components of the blocks in a running environment.

=SML
fun €flatten_env› ([] : ENV) : IN_SCOPE = (
	empty_in_scope
) |  flatten_env [blk] = (
	#in_scope(#declab blk)
) |  flatten_env (blk1 :: (blks as (blk2 :: _))) = (
	merge_declabs
	(#block_name (#declab blk1))
	(#in_scope (#declab blk1))
	(#block_name  (#declab blk2))
	(flatten_env blks)
);
=TEX
The following function is used here and elsewhere to find the HOL name corresponding to a Z one.
=SML
fun €z_id_of_id› (n : ID) : Z_ID = (
	(fst o dest_const o mk_z_gvar)(n, BOOL, [])
);
=TEX
Now we define $subprog\_flatten\_env$: the $filter\_XXX$ functions implement
the set comprehensions in the specification, with $filter_env$ fitting
the results together into an $IN\_SCOPE$.
=TEX
=SML
fun €expand_schema_sigs› (ns : Z_ID list) : Z_ID list = (
	let	fun aux n = (
			((map fst o dest_z_schema_type o dest_z_power_type o
			force_value o get_const_type) (z_id_of_id n))
			handle Fail _ => [n]
		);
	in	flat (map aux ns)
	end
);
=SML
fun €subprog_flatten_env› ([] : ENV) : IN_SCOPE = (
	empty_in_scope
) |  subprog_flatten_env (blocks : ENV) = (
	let	val block1 = hd blocks;
		val flags = #flags (#declab block1);
	in	if	not(#formal_body_flag flags)
		then	flatten_env blocks
		else	let	val (name, globals1) = subprog_info block1;
				val blocks2 = blocks drop
					(fn b => #block_name (#declab b) <> name);
				val {dict, dec_labels} = flatten_env blocks2;

In addition to the above, we keep a database mapping script names to the corresponding
states.

\subsection{Error Management}
=SML
val €cn_stop_on_exceptions› : bool ref = ref true;

type €CN_EXCEPTION_LOG› = string list S_DICT;
val €exception_log› : CN_EXCEPTION_LOG ref = ref initial_s_dict;
val €exception_handled› : bool ref = ref false;

In the following, the special first two clauses are for SML/NJ (for which {\it string\_of\_exn} loses information).
=SML

\subsection{Accessing the Running Environment}
The function $block$ below implements the 1-based indexing of the running environment which is such a common feature of the Z spec.
=SML
fun €block› (index : int) : BLOCK = (
	(nth (index - 1) (!blocks))
	handle Fail _ => error "block" 507006 []
); 
=TEX
The following function is convenient for accessing the flags in the running environment.
The first parameter is the functions to extract the flag value: it will always be one of the ML built-in selection functions, $\#pack\_spec\_flag$ etc.
The second parameter gives the block to get the flag from: with $1$ identifying the topmost block.
=SML
fun €test_flag› (selector : FLAGS -> bool) (index : int) : bool = (
	(selector o #flags o #declab o block) index
);
=TEX
The specification does not specify the block name to be used in the bottom block in the running environment.
It is convenient to use this to tell the code which stores VCs the name of the current web clause.
The following two functions assist in this.
=SML
fun €set_bottom_block_name› (n : ID) : unit = (
	let	fun aux [] = [block_block_name(empty_block, n)]
		|   aux [blk] = [block_block_name(blk, n)]
		|   aux (blk :: more) = blk :: aux more;
	in	blocks := aux (!blocks)
	end
);
=TEX
=SML
fun €get_bottom_block_name› (() : unit) : ID = (
	let	fun aux [] = ""
		|   aux [blk :BLOCK] = #block_name(#declab blk)
		|   aux (blk :: more) = aux more;
	in	aux (!blocks)
	end
);
=TEX
=SML
fun €get_pack_body_name› (() : unit) : ID OPT = (
	case !blocks of
		blk :: _ =>
		let	val dl = #declab blk;
		in	if	#pack_body_flag (#flags dl)
			then	Value(#block_name dl)
			else	Nil
		end
	|	[] => Nil
);
=TEX
\subsection{Theory User Data}
The so-called user data part of a ProofPower theory is used to hold various information about the literate scripts which have been or are being processed.
We collect together here those parts of the code concerned with this which do not depend on later material.

The following are the user data key reserved for the Compliance Tool.
=SML
val €cn_theories_ud_key› = "CN'theories";
val €cn_spec_ud_key› = "CN'createspec";
val €cn_subunit_ud_key› = "CN'createsubunit";
val €cn_new_parent_ud_key› = "CN'newparent";
val €cn_script_library_theories_ud_key› = "CN'script_library_theories";
val €cn_created_ud_key› = "CN'created";
val €cn_compilation_unit_ud_key› = "CN'compilation_unit";
val €cn_vc_context_and_origin_key› = "CN'vc_context_origin";
val €cn_stub_script_name_key› = "CN'cn_stub_script_name";
val €cn_continuation_script_key› = "CN'cn_continuation_script_key";
=TEX

The following functions to open out theory user data
are used in several places;
callers must handle the exception they can raise.

=SML
fun €dest_ud_string› (UD_String (n, uds)) = (n, uds)
|   dest_ud_string _ = fail "" 0 [] (* Caller MUST catch this *);
=TEX
=SML
fun €dest_ud_int› (UD_Int (n, uds)) = (n, uds)
|   dest_ud_int _ = fail "" 0 [] (* Caller MUST catch this *);
=TEX
=SML
fun €dest_ud_term› (UD_Term (n, uds)) = (n, uds)
|   dest_ud_term _ = fail "" 0 [] (* Caller MUST catch this *);
=TEX

The following function updates the user data for the current theory.  Given a user data key and an item of data it retrieves any data currently stored under that key, adds the new data to it and then stores the result under the key.

=SML
fun €update_user_datum› (key : string) (xs : USER_DATUM) =
let
    val old_datum = (snd o dest_ud_string o get_user_datum "-")
					key handle Fail _ => [];
    val new_datum = xs::old_datum;
in
    set_user_datum(key, UD_String ("",new_datum))
end;
=TEX
The following sets a user data flag to indicate that the theory
was created by the compliance notation tool (e.g. by $new\_script$,
or perhaps as a stub or other supporting theory).
=SML
fun €set_cn_created› () : unit = (
	set_user_datum (cn_created_ud_key, UD_String("CN created",[]))
);
=TEX
And the following checks for the flag:
=SML
fun €get_cn_created› (thy : string) : bool = (
	(get_user_datum thy cn_created_ud_key; true) 
	handle (Fail _) => false
);
=TEX

The following functions are used to maintain the list of theories ``belonging'' to the current literate script.
=SML
fun €get_script_theories› (thy : string) : string list = (
	(map (fst o dest_ud_string) o snd o dest_ud_string o get_user_datum thy)
	cn_theories_ud_key
	handle Fail _ => []
);
=TEX
=SML
fun €add_script_theory› (thy : string) : unit = (
	do_in_theory (!script_name)
	(fn () => update_user_datum cn_theories_ud_key (UD_String(thy, []))) ()
);
=TEX
The following should be used when about to add material for
a compilation unit to a theory. 
It raised a failure if a different compilation unit has already used the theory.
This function implements check 17.
The name is stored for the purposes of this check and to use
in the error message.
=SML
fun €set_cu› (cu_name: string) : unit = (
let	val dummy = if (get_cn_created "-")
			then ()
			else fail "check17" 507056 [fn () => cu_name,
				fn () => get_current_theory_name()];	
	val (was, _) = dest_ud_string(get_user_datum "-"
				 cn_compilation_unit_ud_key)
			handle Fail _ => ("" ,[]);
in
	if (was = "")
	then set_user_datum(cn_compilation_unit_ud_key, UD_String (cu_name,[]))
	else if (was = cu_name)
	then ()
	else fail "check17" 507045 [fn () => cu_name,
				fn () => get_current_theory_name(),
				fn () => was]
end);
=TEX
The following is necessary when the key has been set incorrectly.
In particular, $duplicate\_theory$ copies keys, which is not helpful
in this case.
To support script deletion, we remember the name of the theory in which the stub which
gave rise to the duplicate came from.
=SML
fun €set_duplicate_keys› (cu_name: string, stub_script_name) : unit = (
	set_user_datum(cn_compilation_unit_ud_key, UD_String (cu_name,[]));
	set_user_datum(cn_stub_script_name_key, UD_String (stub_script_name,[]))
);
=TEX
=SML
fun €get_stub_script_name› (thy: string) : string OPT = (
	Value(fst(dest_ud_string(get_user_datum thy cn_stub_script_name_key)))
	handle Fail _ => Nil
);
=TEX
=SML
fun €set_continuation_flag› (flag : bool) : unit = (
	set_user_datum(cn_continuation_script_key, UD_Int (if flag then 1 else 0, []))
);
=TEX
=SML
fun €get_continuation_flag› (thy: string) : bool = (
	fst(dest_ud_int(get_user_datum thy cn_continuation_script_key)) = 1
	handle Fail _ => false
);
=TEX
The following functions are used to maintain the list of library theories ``belonging'' to the current literate script.
=SML
fun €get_library_theories› (thy : string) : string list = (
	(map (fst o dest_ud_string) o snd o dest_ud_string o get_user_datum thy)
	cn_script_library_theories_ud_key
	handle Fail _ => []
);
=TEX
=SML
fun €add_library_theory› (thy : string) : unit = (
	do_in_theory (!script_name)
	(fn () => update_user_datum cn_script_library_theories_ud_key
			(UD_String(thy, []))) ()
);
=TEX

The next function adds a new parent to the current theory, and makes an entry of this fact in the current theory's user data.
If $allow\_fail$ is true, the function will not raise $Fail$: if the attempt to add the parent fails then the exception is caught and the error message is output as part of a comment.
=SML
fun €new_parent_aux› (allow_fail : bool) (thy : string) : unit = (
	if	not (thy mem get_parents "-")
	then	(	new_parent thy;
			update_user_datum cn_new_parent_ud_key
				(UD_String(thy, [UD_Int (current_level(),[])])) )
		handle ex as (Fail msg) =>
		if allow_fail
		then	 (
			if	thy mem get_descendants "min"
			then	comment "new_parent_aux" 507034
					[fn () => thy,
					 get_current_theory_name,
					fn () => get_message msg]
			else	comment "new_parent_aux" 507035
					[fn () => thy, get_current_theory_name]
		) else	reraise ex "new_parent_aux"
	else	()
);
=TEX
The following function creates a new theory (with a given list of theories to be made parents in addition to the current theory) and tries to make sure
it has the current cache theory in its ancestry. This circumvents
a misfeature in versions of ProofPower up to and including 0.5.
=SML
fun €new_theory_aux› (parents : string list) (thy : string) : unit = (
	new_theory thy;
	(case get_cache_theories () of
		cthy :: _ => (
			if	not(cthy mem get_ancestors thy)
			then	new_parent_aux true cthy
			else	()
	) | 	_ => ());
	map (new_parent_aux true) parents;
	()
);
=TEX

	cn_env_of_in_scope

=TEX
To help with processing record types the following function takes a type definition and
for a record type returnsthe appropriate entity info giving the component names in order and the number of discriminants.
In accordance with the Ada rules, the discriminants are included, in order, as
the leading sublist of the components.
For other sorts of Ada type we need only record the fact that the Z global variable represents an Ada type.
=SML
fun €entity_info_of_type_def› (TDRecordTypeDef {decl, disc} : TYPE_DEF) : ENTITY_INFO = (
	let	val discs = flat (map #vars disc);
		val others = flat (map (#vars o fst) decl);
		val ty = force_value
	in	EIEnvRecordType{comp_names = discs @ others, num_discs = length discs}
	end
) | entity_info_of_type_def _ = EIEnvOtherType;

=SML
fun €entity_info_of_private_type_decl› (_ : PRIVATE_TYPE_DECL) : ENTITY_INFO = (

=TEX
Once we have the environment info, we can generate the environment info for it.
We do not need to provide the type here, but we do if it is available: subsequently, when the environment info is used,
{\em env\_of\_env\_dict} will fill it in from the HOL type of the constant if it is not in the environment info.

The following is used to add the typing context for a parameter list into the context temporarily. It returns the context which should be restored when the parameters are no longer needed.
In order to reuse earler code for handling the parameter specifications, we need to process
them using an IN\_SCOPE that contains all the type marks that may appear in them.
However, we don't want to flatten out the resulting type inference context, but only to add the entries for the parameters into it (if this is done in a context where the Z types are out of scope, caller is doomed in any case).
Hence we build a new efficient context for the parameters (and anything else that it's in the running environment) and then look the parameters up in it and add them to the new context that we are going to set up.

We first describe the addition of context and origin for VCs and then 
the addition of the VCs themselves.

\subsubsection{Adding VC Context and Origin}
The VC context and origin are described by user data according to this abstract syntax ( where 
\texttt{ROUTE} is actually \texttt{TERM}):

 Then we shall need to find the origin of a 
VC from its name and form an abbreviated abstract syntax tree from the true abstract syntax
of the clause and the recorded walk. We do this in a depth first left to right walk of the 
tree in synchrony with a walk along the route. 

Our unit of database atomicity is the web clause, so we can add one context and any number
of origins and then put the data back again.

For various (good) reasons, the underlying {\Product} operations of adding new parent or saving a conjecture (e.g., a VC) do not increment the level counter.
In order for the Z document generator to be able to output the necessary commands in the right place, we make and deletes a dummy type declaration before storing each batch of VCs to force the level counter up.
In order to avoid a potential infinite loop (e.g., if the current theory is not writable), the attempt to do this dummy declaration is abandoned after 10,000 goes (this protects the code against an extremely unlikely event!)

The processing of declarations can give rise to VCs.
These are delivered as conjecture paragraphs.

the following interface to the function for storing Z paragraphs.
Currently VCs cannot be generic, and so the interface below does not cater for generic VCs.

The following attempts to store a paragraph, and then tidies everything
away again.
$delete\_top\_theory\_past\_level$ is taken verbatim from
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD049}.
This is used when a function (formal or informal) is encountered in a package specification to check that
the function name does not clash with an existing Z global variable and, for a formal function, to
ensure that the pre- and post-conditions are well-typed. As currently coded, the function
would not check that a conjecture has no free variables, but that check is not required in the
current usage.

\section{STATEMENTS}\label{STATEMENTS}
\subsection{Support for Processing Specification Statement}
The code that follows is essentially the implementation of {\it vc\_speclabel}
with an option not to store the generated VCs. This facility is used to
make checks on a specification statement (as statement) as soon as it is encountered
rather than waiting until someone tries to refine it (which they may never do).

The code does not follow the specification in fishing the label out of the environment
but takes it from the argument (which will have the same value in the call that actually
generates VCs and can be chosen by caller in the call that just makes checks).
The speclab is augmented by any variables brought into scope by a for-loop.

This is analogous to {\it update\_envs\_proc}, but as we need to distinguish formal and informal functions, it is called from the appropriate SID functions rather than as a SID function.

guarantees conformance of the formal parameter parts).

In the following, we only need to look in the immediately surrounding declarative
part and not further out (the rules on redeclarations in inner scopes
will prevent there being any possibility of a clash with an outer procedure).
To be consistent with the handling of the environment dictionaries, the new entry in the immediately enclosing block is also added to the current block.

\subsection{The SID function new\_scope\_with}
N.B. $new\_scope\_pack\_body$ has been moved after this section.

The prefixing of names required for $new\_scope\_with$ demands a fair amount of {\Product}-specific code which is not formally specified.
The main issue is that we have to type-check every term in which names are to be prefixed in order to perform a semantically correct substitution using the HOL substitution operation.
The approach is to introduce a temporary theory into which we put Z paragraphs representing the objects in the package with their names unprefixed.
In the context of this temporary theory, we can type-check all the terms which appear as procedure specifications etc.

First of all we define $new\_ids$ according to the specification.

=SML
fun €new_ids› (p : PACKAGE) : ID list = (
	let	val {vc_vars, consts_types, formal_procs,
			informal_funs, formal_funs, aux_vars, var_renamings, ...} = p;
		val v = flat (map #vars vc_vars);
		fun do_enums ({type_def,...} : TYPE_DEF TYPE_DECL) = (
			case type_def of
				TDEnumTypeDef etd =>		#vals etd
			|	_ =>				[]
		);
		val c_t_ident_s = flat (map (fn ct =>
				case ct of
					BDConstDecl cd =>	#consts cd
				|	BDTypeDecl td =>	#name td :: do_enums td
				|	BDSubtypeDecl std =>	[#name std]
				|	_ =>			[]
				) consts_types);
		val p = map #name formal_procs;
		val f1 = map #name informal_funs;
		val f2 = map (#name o #informal_fun) formal_funs;
		val a = flat (map z_names_of_z_dec aux_vars);
		val rens = map fst var_renamings;

The following function, {\it is\_id\_in\_package}, returns true if $id$ or any of its attributes are in the set of $newids$, or any of its initial variables.

{\it is\_id\_in\_package names ident} first discards any trailing zero-subscript
from {\it ident}; if the result is a member of the list {\it names},
it returns true, otherwise it splits it up into a sequence of
elements separated by the characters `v' or `u'.
Suppose the resulting sequence is equal to $N_0, N_1, ldots Nk$.
The function will then return true iff. each $N_i$ contains no
lower case letters and also one of the following holds:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
$k = 0$ and $N_0$ is in names --- this is just a name defined in the package.
\item
$k = 1$, $N_0$ is in names and the separator between $N_0$ and $N_1$ was `u' --- this
is taken to be a record update function for the type with type mark $N_0$.
\item
$k \ge 1$, $N_0$ is in names, each $N_i$, for $1 \le i \le k $, is an attribute identifier
and the separators were all `v' --- this is taken to be the translation of an attribute.
\item
$k \ge 2$, $N_0$ is in names, each $N_i$, for $1 \le i < k$, is an attribute identifier,
the separators were all `v' and $N_k$ is a decimal number ---
this is taken to be the translation of an attribute with a numeric argument.
\end{enumerate}

The handling of the theory hierarchy was rationalised considerably during
the IUCT project in 1997. Unfortunately, a small amount of legacy code
and nomenclature persisted beyond that project. The ``internal specification
theory'' that used to be set up to hold the Z definitions needed to type-check
a package specification is no longer needed --- the one-compilation-unit-per-script
rule now means that it is the user who defines the script theory in which
those Z definitions are placed. By agreement with DERA a potential soundness problem
is avoided by agreeing that Z definitions are not generated for the functions
in the package. Thus the former ``internal specification theory'' is replaced
by the ``specification script theory''.

In the case of a package nested within a package or subprogram body, the
``specification script theory'' is the script theory for the containing body.


The following function extracts from the specification script theory the types
(corresponding to given sets) and the constants
(corresponding to global variables) together with their definitions if any.

In $new\_scope\_with$, we also need to prefix names occurring in the specification statements in any formal procedures in the withed package.
In order to do the relevant substitutions, we need to type check the Z predicates in the specification statements.
This has already been done at the point of originally entering the specification
theory.
The following function returns information which the caller may need.
It returns a triple comprising: the list of type substitutions which need to be made; the list of formal procedures with the relevant names prefixed in the specs. the prefixed auxiliary variables and the prefixed variable renamings).

The script theory becomes current after successful or unsuccessful execution.

\subsection{The SID function update\_envs\_pack\_spec}

In {\it update\_envs\_pack\_spec}, we need to proceed much as in {\it new\_scope\_with},
but adding the prefixed Z material to the script theory to support package
specifications nested inside package or subprogram bodies.
The following analogue of {\it z\_prefix} does this.

\subsection{The SID function renames\_object}
The implementation organises the logic a little differently from the specification but with the
same effect. It checks whether the renaming is a constant renaming simply by trying to
store the relevant abbreviation definition in the current theory (using {\it bd\_store\_para} so that
if the object renaming simply duplicates an earlier one it is accepted). This is guaranteed to
fail if the renaming is a legal variable renaming. If it succeeds, then we're done, otherwise
we do the appropriate work for variable renaming. Thus {\it renames\_object\_common}
below does the work of both {\it renames\_var\_common} and {\it renames\_const}, hence
the change of name. Likewise for {\it renames\_object\_pack\_spec}.

The following reflects the SID functions for $statement$ (see also $loop\_statement$ and $loop\_parameter\_specification$.

To have the same order of invocation of the SID functions for for- and while- loop statements as in the specification, it is necessary to ``expand in line'' the processing for their constituent loops.

Note that the parser is not expected to produce the {\it SSpecIvars}, {\it SProcIvars} or {\it SForNonStatic} alternatives, since it cannot carry out the necessary analysis of free variables.
It uses the no-initial-variables or static forms to carry the information
on, since these forms are adequately general.
The $STATEMENT$ alternatives are produced where necessary in the VC generator.
