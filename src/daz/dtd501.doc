\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}

This document contains the detailed design for the compliance notation lexical analyser. It supports the lexis defined in the SPARK Manual \cite{pvl90} required to support the Compliance Tool as specified by DRA in \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/TR/94/27/1.2}.

\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}

Two signatures are introduced in this document. The first is $CaseIndependence$ and provides a couple of useful utilities for the conversion of lowercase strings to uppercase and vice-versa. The second is called $CNLex$ and contains one function $cn\_lex$ which converts the input (from the Compliance Notation Reader/Writer) and lexically analyses it according to the SPARK lexis to produce a list of lexical items.

\subsubsection{Dependencies}

The function $cn\_lex$ in $CNLex$ depends on data types introduced in the structure $CNTypes$ which is defined in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD502}.

\subsection{Compliance}

The functions in this document provide a means of lexically analysing the user's input. The target data type can be found in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD502}.

All Spark names are stored in the Compliance Tool internally in upper case in a dictionary. This enables issues relating to case sensitivity to be factored out, and by ensuring that the implementation calls $get\_internal\_names$ to convert Spark names to their upper-case equivalent at the appropriate points, no other part of the implementation need be concerned with case sensitivity. 

\section{THE SIGNATURES}
\subsection{The Signature $CaseIndependence$}
=DOC
signature ÛCaseIndependenceÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
This is the signature of a structure containing utilities to assist
in implementing support for languages where equality of identifiers
is independent of the case of letters.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûto_lowerÝ : string -> string
val Ûto_upperÝ : string -> string
=DESCRIBE
$to\_lower\,s$ is $s$ with all upper-case letters replaced by their
lower-case equivalents.

$to\_upper\,s$ is $s$ with all lower-case letters replaced by their
upper-case equivalents.
=ENDDOC
=IGNORE
=DOC
val Ûget_internal_nameÝ : string -> string
val Ûget_external_nameÝ : string -> string
val Ûreset_namesÝ : unit -> unit
=DESCRIBE
$get\_internal\_name$ stores its argument in a dictionary whose key is the capitalised form of the argument. If there is already an entry in the table whose capitalisation differs from that of the argument provided, a warning message is generated stating the inconsistent use of case. Otherwise no message is produced and the table is not updated. $get\_internal\_name$ always returns the capitalised form of the argument.

$get\_external\_name$ looks up in the dictionary the entry corresponding whose key is the capitalised form of the argument. If an entry is found, it is returned; otherwise $get\_external\_name$ is the identity function and just returns its argument.

$reset\_names$ clears the dictionary of all the entries.
=USES
These functions are used by the lexical analyser to convert SPARK names to a uniform internal form and facilitating the detection inconsistent case usage.

=FAILURE
501100	Inconsistent use of case: "?0", "?1"
=ENDDOC
=SML
end; (* of signature CaseIndependence *)
=TEX

\subsection{The Signature $CNLex$}
=DOC
signature ÛCNLexÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
This is the signature for the structure containing the lexical analyser for Compliance Notation.
=ENDDOC

=TEX
\subsection{The Lexical Analyser Function}
=DOC
val Ûcn_lexÝ : (CNTypes.CN_LEX_ITEM list -> CNTypes.CN_LEX_ITEM list)
			-> Lex.INPUT list -> CNTypes.CN_LEX_ITEM list
=DESCRIBE
$cn\_lex$ is the function which lexically analyses a list of items and produces a list of lexemes corresponding to the SPARK Lexis.

The first argument of $cn\_lex$ is a function which transforms recognises a list of items which begin with an open-parenthesis character followed by a number and converts this into a lexical token corresponding to a particular type of web-clause. This enables labelled web-clauses to be classified prior to parsing and this serves to reduce the size of the grammar for web-clauses significantly.

The second argument to $cn\_lex$ is a list of input items which is the output of the reader/writer when a web-clause is recognised.
=USES
$cn\_lex$ is not called by the user directly; it is intended to be called by the web-clause processor.
=FAILURE
501001	Lexical analysis error: ?0 is not allowed here in Compliance Notation
501002	Parser internal error: ?0
501003	error code ?0 reported by reader/writer
=ENDDOC
=TEX

=SML
end; (* of signature CNLex *)
=TEX

\section{TEST POLICY}
The functions in this document are to be tested according to the
criteria identified in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/PLN003}.
