\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document gives an overview high level design for the Compliance Notation Tool.
The document is the top level of a suite of documents which form the response to the product definition \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DEF501}.
It is intended to conform to all relevant local standards for designs identified in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/PLN003}.


\subsection{Introduction}
A Compliance Tool for processing Compliance Notation is required by DRA as part of the contract MAL 1a/0493 \cite{MAL1A/0493}.
The Compliance Notation is a convenient way of expressing a program written in SPARK together with the specification of what the program should do. A program and its specification expressed in Compliance Notation helps an observer to ascertain whether the program meets its specification.
The Compliance Notation is designed with automation of verification conditions in mind, and a technique for generating the verification conditions for a Compliance Notation literate script is provided in {\VolumeTwo}.  
The required Tool processes Compliance Notation to produce two outputs; a SPARK program which can subsequently compiled with an Ada Compiler, and a Z Document which includes verification conditions. (REQ.21.1.1.1)
The concrete syntax of Compliance Notation and the format of the Z Document are specified in {\DRASpecs}.
The design of the Compliance Tool meets all the general requirements in \cite[section 3.1]{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DEF501}. 

\subsubsection{Background and Requirements}
The requirements for the Compliance Tool are stated in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DEF501} which are an organised digest of the contractual requirements  annotated with requirement numbers for traceability.

As stated in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DEF501} a key algorithm to be implemented by the tool is specified in the DRA's {\DRASpecs}.


\subsubsection{Dependencies}
The system whose design is described here is self-contained.

\subsection{Compliance}
An important requirement on the Compliance Notation design is traceability againsts DRA's specifications of certain critical functional areas.
The approach to be taken to this is that the detailed design documents will comprise not only Standard ML signatures together with narrative descriptions (as normal for {\Product} developments), but also DRA's Z specifications transcribed into {\ProductZ}. The Standard ML structures meeting these signatures will be coded so as to correspond closely with the Z specifications. (This approach was prototyped, but with the Z and the implementing code directly interleaved, in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/ZED002} supplied as an annex to the project proposal).

The main role of the high level design is to coordinate the detailed design with the total requirement as summarised in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DEF501}.

The high level design documents discuss the approach adopted for compliance, covering aspects of the development and documentation methods used for supporting the compliance argument.

\section{PROCESSING OVERVIEW}\label{PROCESSINGOVERVIEW}
Processing of Compliance Notation scripts follows the same paradigm as that used for specifications and proofs in HOL and Z on {\Product}.
This paradigm is a development of Milner's LCF paradigm for supporting interactive proof using a functional programming language.

The user uses an interactive text editor to prepare literate scripts containing a mixture of formal and informal material.
At any time during preparation of a script formal material may be transferred into a window in which the compiler for the interactive metalanguage {\ProductML} runs.
A user interface with the Motif look and feel facilitates both the editing and the interaction with the {\ProductML} compiler

{\ProductML} is an extension of the functional programming language Standard ML (via a macro-processing front-end and extensions to the pretty-printer) which allows fragments of formal material to be entered and evaluated as expressions.
For example, when a Z paragraph is entered, the macro-processor (often referred to as the ``Reader/Writer'') invokes a function which causes the text of the Z paragraph to be parsed, type-checked, and, if correct, used to update a database (the {\Product} theory database) with information capturing the logical and syntactic content of the paragraph.
This information is then available (often automatically) for future use, e.g., in type-checking later paragraphs or when a definition is accessed in a proof.
A simple example of a Z specification is discussed further in section \ref{TheoryHierarchy} below.

In the case of the Compliance Notation script, the formal material will comprise the various sorts of Compliance Notation clause.
The Z paragraph clauses are handled as they stand by the {\Product} support for Z specification.
The other clauses are parsed, type-checked and used to update environments (based on those defined in {\DRASpecs}) which are held in the {\Product} theory database and which incorporate an image of the Z document corresponding to the literate script in the same form as if that had been entered directly using the usual {\Product} facilities for entering pure Z specifications.
Thus the algorithms of {\DRASpecs} are invoked as the Compliance Notation clauses are entered.
By invoking appropriate metalanguage functions the user may ask for the environments to be processed in various ways, in particular, the user may ask for the Z document corresponding to the literate script to be output (which is essentially just a pretty-printing task).

The functional units which carry out the Compliance Notation processing are described in more detail in section \ref{ComplianceNotationProcessing} below.
The remainder of section \ref{SYSTEMDECOMPOSITION} describes the functional decomposition of other aspects of the overall Compliance Notation Tool.
Section \ref{DATASTORAGE} describes the various sorts of data dealt with by the tool and gives an overview of the representation of that data.



\section{SYSTEM DECOMPOSITION}\label{SYSTEMDECOMPOSITION}
The organisation of the Compliance Tool as perceived by the user is shown in \cite[table 1]{ISS/HAT/DAZ/PLN003} and is reproduced in this document for the reader's convenience as Table \ref{SystemStructure}.

\caption{System Structure}\label{SystemStructure}
\end{table}

The items to be developed as part of the Compliance Tool are shown in {\bf bold font} in the table.
For present purposes, it is convenient to group these items under three headings:
{\em User Interface}, covering the Basic and Custom HCI; {\em Compliance Notation Processing}, including Z and SPARK extraction and the toolkit extension; and {\em Custom Proof Facilities}.
These are discussed further in sections \ref{UserInterface}, \ref{ComplianceNotationProcessing} and \ref{CustomProofFacilities} below.
This grouping allows commonality between the functions to be exploited in the design.



\subsection{User Interface}\label{UserInterface}
\subsubsection{Basic HCI}
The Basic HCI subsystem is to be a simple customisation of the {\Product} X/Motif interface to cater for the new languages to be processed. (REQ.215.1.1.1)
	
\subsubsection{Custom HCI}
The custom HCI subsystem provides a Templates Tool for easy entry of Compliance Notation Constructs, a Help System describing its use together with a VC Browser enabling navigation between VCs and the clauses producing them.
The high-level design for this subsystem is given in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/HLD502}
(REQ.812.1.1, REQ.812.1.2, REQ.812.2.1).

\subsection{Compliance Notation Processing}\label{ComplianceNotationProcessing}

The SPARK program extractor takes Compliance Notation and produces a SPARK program which can be subsequently checked with an Ada Compiler.
The Z document extractor takes Compliance Notation and produces a Z document.
The Z toolkit extensions  comprise a small Z specification on which the Z document extraction depends (since it supplies typing information for objects which may be referenced in the extracted Z document, and {\Product} will be used to enforce type-correctness of all Z as it is generated.).
These three items are treated together as a single subsystem in this High Level Design.
This subsystem is itself further divided into subsystems and is described in further detail in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/HLD503}.

Sections \ref{ComplianceNotationInput}-\ref{ZToolkitExtensions} below give an overview of the subsystems identified  in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/HLD503} and discuss the rationale behind the design.

\subsubsection{Compliance Notation Input}\label{ComplianceNotationInput}

Both the Z and SPARK extractors have a considerable amount of common functionality in the lexical analysis, parsing and conversion of Compliance Notation.
Since it is required to supply a capability for Compliance Notation scripts to be presented and processed one clause at a time, it is sensible to have the processing which is common to both Z and SPARK extraction performed once per clause and then have the specific processing be performed by functions operating on a common intermediate representation of the Compliance Notation script. (REQ.213.2.1.1)

The common functionality will be referred to as the {\em Compliance Notation Input} subsystem.

The concrete syntax of Compliance Notation recognised by the tool is specified in {\VolumeOne}. (REQ.213.3.1.1) 
Entering (correct) Compliance Notation into the Tool causes the intermediate representation of the Compliance Notation script to be stored internally in the Compliance Tool.
The generation of the Z Document and the SPARK program can be obtained readily from the intermediate represention.
Entry of syntactically incorrect Compliance Notation causes appropriate diagnostics to be reported to the user.

Compliance Notation comprises a sequence of web clauses interspersed with English Text and this constitutes a literate script.
The web clauses are processed by the Compliance Tool and the English text is ignored.
The web clause is the basic unit of recognition for the Compliance Tool.
The clauses which constitute Z syntax (i.e., Z paragraphs) can be processed by {\Product} already.
Additional support is required to process the other kinds of web clause (e.g., SPARK programs, refined-by statements).
The processing of web clauses to produce an abstract representation comprises the following functions:

\begin{description}

\item[\bf Clause Recognition]
The facilities provided by {\Product} give a uniform framework for the special markup required to identify the Web clauses in the literate script.

When a web clause is presented to the Compliance Tool, the markup causes a {\Product} subsystem called the Reader/Writer to be invoked.
The Reader/Writer is, in effect, a preprocessor for Standard ML intended to permit the use of Standard ML as a metalanguage for an extensible range of object languages.
The Reader/Writer is set up to arrange for the contents of a web clause to be passed on to the subsequent phases of Compliance Notation processing.

The set-up for the Z paragraph alternative for a web clause can be the same as the usual set-up for {\ProductZ} processing and so these can use the existing markup defined for {\ProductZ}.
Other sorts of clause are handled by a markup sequence defined for the purpose.


\item[\bf Lexical Analysis]
Web clauses are lexically analysed using the Compliance Notation lexical analyser. This provides a lexical representation based on Compliance Notation lexical classes for input into the Compliance Notation parser.


\item[\bf Parsing]
The lexical representation of a web clause is parsed and produces an abstract representation of the Compliance Notation in addition to building up an environment for subsequently producing the Z document if this should be requested.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Z Generation}
A data structure representing the Z document is generated as part of the intermediate representation of the Compliance Notation script. Each of the parsed web clauses is stored in the {\Product} theory database and the Z document environment is modified as each web clause is entered. Generation of Z for subsequent output is done during the process of parsing. The details of this process are specified in {\VolumeOne}. (REQ.213.1.1.1)

Note that extraction of the Z document into a file is not necessary for proof work or other analysis (e.g. browsing). The {\Product} theory database contains the same representation of the Z document as would be produced by loading it as a {\ProductZ} script in the usual way. (REQ.213.1.3.1)

\subsubsection{SPARK Generation}
The SPARK program is generated from the abstract representation by recursively passing over an abstract representation of the literate script, filling in the k-slots.

\subsubsection{Z and SPARK Output}
Once the SPARK program has been produced in the abstract form, it may be ``pretty-printed'' either on screen or to a file. (REQ.214.1.1.1)
Likewise, the Z document can be produced by invoking a function to write the Z paragraphs and the verification conditions on screen or to a file in the order and format suggested in {\VolumeOne}. (REQ.213.1.2.1)
The Z conforms to {\ProductZ} concrete syntax. (REQ.213.4.1.1), and the verification conditions generated are readily processable using the proof facilities of {\Product}. (REQ.213.5.1.1)


\subsubsection{Z Toolkit Extensions}\label{ZToolkitExtensions}
The Z Toolkit Extensions of Appendix B of {\VolumeOne} comprise Z definitions which need only to be stored in a {\Product-Z} theory in the usual way. (REQ.212.1.1.1)


\subsection{Custom Proof Facilities}\label{CustomProofFacilities}
This aspect of the design work is scheduled for later in the development and this document will then be updated.

\section{DATA STORAGE AND FORMATS}\label{DATASTORAGE}
\subsection{Input Files}
Compliance Notation literate scripts are represented as {\Product} literate scripts.
The markup for Z paragraphs, web clauses etc., uses the mechanisms described in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR001}.
Literate scripts are stored as text files and may be edited with an ordinary text editor.
Normally, a 256-bit character set is used for special symbols in the scripts;
however, a {\Product} utility may be used to convert to and from a representation using ASCII keywords for the non-ASCII symbols.


\subsection{Output Files}
The Z document is a {\Product} literate script.

The SPARK program is a text file and contains no special markup.

\subsection{Compliance Notation}

\subsubsection{Background: the {\Product} Theory Hierarchy}\label{TheoryHierarchy}.

In {\Product}, the axioms, definitions and (proved) theorems which represent the results of specification and proof work are organised into a hierarchy of named {\em theories}.
This theory hierarchy is a directed acyclic graph with root a theory $min$ which introduces the primitive constants of the {\ProductHOL} logic.
The theory hierarchy determines the scope of the axioms, definitions and theorems in each theory: a definition in a theory $t$, say, is only in scope in theories which can be reached from $t$ in the directed graph.
The {\ProductZ} support provides a particular theory hierarchy culminating in a theory $z\_library$ which supplies a scope in which all of the Z toolkit is available.

The organisation of a specification within the theory hierarchy is defined by metalanguage commands which name the theories introduced and define their place in the hierarchy.
The system maintains a notion of {\em current theory}:
during specification work the current theory is the one in which new definitions and axioms are stored;
during proof work, the current theory defines the definitions and axioms which are available for reasoning;
when a new theory is introduced it becomes the current theory and it has one parent which is the previous current theory.

For example, the following sets up a typical lozenge-shaped organisation within the theory hierarchy.

{\small
=SML
open_theory"z_library";		(* current theory now z_library *)
new_theory"A";			(* introduces A; parents(A) = {z_library} *)
¹Z
a ¦ [x, y: ú]			(* schema definition stored in A *)
°
=SML
new_theory"B";			(* introduces B; parents(B) = {A}; current theory now B *)
¹Z
b ¦ [a; z: ú]			(* schema definition stored in B *)
°
=SML
open_theory"A";		(* current theory becomes A *)
new_theory"C";			(* introduces C; parents(C) = {A}; current theory now C *)
¹Z
c ¦ [a; w: ú]			(* schema definition stored in C *)
°
=SML
new_theory"D";			(* introduces D; parents(D) = {C}; current theory now D *)
new_parent"B";			(* parents(D) = {B, C} *)
¹Z
d ¦ [b; c]			(* schema definition stored in D *)
°
}
In order to facilitate experimentation with the contents of a theory which has children, {\Product} provides a function $duplicate\_theory$ which creates a new theory which is a copy of an existing theory except with no children.
This feature can also be used to take a checkpoint on the state of a theory under development.

=TEX
\subsubsection{Representing the Compliance Notation}
As a Compliance Notation literate script is processed, an intermediate representation of it is built up within {\Product}.
From time to time at the user's request, this intermediate representation is used to write out the SPARK program or the Z document to a file.
It is convenient to have the intermediate representation mapped into the {\Product} theory hierarchy so as to reflect the modular structure of the SPARK program.
The DRA specification {\VolumeOne} indicate that the Z documents will be organised into ``modules'' and the use made of these suggests that each module should correspond to a {\Product} theory.

In addition to its logical content, a {\Product} theory provides programmable storage for so-called user data.
Despite the name, this is intended for use in {\Product} applications for storing application-specific information.
For example, it is used for information such as operator fixity whose form is specific to a particular object language (such as {\ProductZ}).
For the Compliance Tool, the user data component of the theory provides a natural  home for the various environments used in generating the Z and SPARK documents.

The mapping of the intermediate representation onto the {\Product} hierarchy is best described in terms of the Compliance Notation language constructs which cause new theories to be introduced.
Table \ref{IntermediateRepresentation} summarises the mapping.
The various environments referred to in the table are those defined in {\VolumeOne}.
A theory is allocated for each literate script, this contains the Z paragraphs in the script together with the VCs and other Z fragments produced by the algorithm of {\DRASpecs}.
An additional theory is also generated for each package specification and for each subprogram stub (corresponding to the discussion of the possible use of Z `modules' in {\VolumeOne}).
The package specification theory is introduced when the package is first referenced in a context clause; the stub theory is introduced when the stub is processed.
The additional theories are siblings of the script theory in the theory hierarchy; parent links are added for the additional theories when necessary.

In the table, the names of the theories are indicated using, for example, ``{\em package}'' to stand for the name of the package in question.
``{\em script}'' refers to a name to be associated with the literate script itself.
Lower-case tags ``{\tt spec}'' and ``{\tt stub}'' are used to distinguish the names two sorts of additional theory.

In table \ref{IntermediateRepresentation}, the phrase ``Z fragments generated'' by a compilation unit is used to refer to VCs and the Z paragraphs corresponding to constant and type declarations.
These are stored in the theory corresponding to the compilation unit and are copied to the output Z document as appropriate.
Some economies of space could be made by making more use of $new\_parent$  than is implied by {\VolumeOne} (which only asks for import/export features to be used in the implementation of subunits).

\def\Stack#1{\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}}#1\end{tabular}}

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{3.75in}|}\hline
Construct & Theory Name & Discussion \\\hline\hline
\Stack{Literate\\script} & \Stack{\em SCRIPT} &
This is the theory containing the Z document for this literate script.
It also contains the information enabling all the theories produced by the script to be located and processed in the correct order when the SPARK program is extracted. All Compliance Notation Z paragraphs are placed into this theory.

This theory also contains the types, constants and functions introduced by a package body together with any VCs generated for the package.
\\\hline

\Stack{Package\\declaration} & \Stack{{\em PACKAGE}{\tt spec}} &
This holds the Z theory for the package and contains the types, constants and functions introduced by the package (each prefixed by the package name). This theory becomes a parent theory of any theory corresponding to a script containing a {\tt with} clause.
\\\hline

\Stack{Main\\program/\\Package \\body} & \Stack{\em SCRIPT} &
The Z for the subprogram or package body is placed in the script theory.
For each context clause (``with''-clause) in the compilation unit, the corresponding package specification theory becomes a parent of the script theory.
\\\hline

\Stack{Body\\stub} & \Stack{{\em UNIT}{\tt o}{\em SUBUNIT}{\tt stub}} &
This holds the Z representing the point in the Z document where the stub was encountered (see {\VolumeOne}). This is done by duplicating the current script theory to create the stub theory.
When the corresponding subunit is processed (which must be in a different literate script from the stub), the stub theory becomes a parent of the script theory.
\\\hline
