\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document gives an overview high level design for the Compliance Notation Tool.
The document is the top level of a suite of documents which form the response to the product definition \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DEF501}.
It is intended to conform to all relevant local standards for designs identified in cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/PLN003}.


\subsection{Introduction}
A Compliance Tool for processing Compliance Notation is required by DRA as part of the contract MAL 1a/0493 \cite{MAL1A/0493}.
The Compliance Notation is a convenient way of expressing a program written in SPARK together with the specification of what the program should do. A program and its specification expressed in Compliance Notation helps an observer to ascertain whether the program meets its specification.
The Compliance Notation is designed with automation of verification conditions in mind, and a technique for generating the verification conditions for a Compliance Notation literate script is provided in \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/1}.  
The required Tool processes Compliance Notation to produce two outputs; a SPARK program which can subsequently compiled with an Ada Compiler, and a Z Document which includes verification conditions.
The concrete syntax of the SPARK program is specified in ??? and the format of the Z Document is specified in \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/2} and illustrated by an example in \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/5}.

\subsubsection{Background and Requirements}
The requirements for the Compliance Tool are stated in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DEF501} which are an organised digest of the contractual requirements  annotated with requirement numbers for traceability.

As stated in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DEF501} a key algorithm to be implemented by the tool is specified in the DRA's \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/1}, \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/2}, \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/4}, \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/5}, \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/6} and \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/9}.


\subsubsection{Dependencies}
The system whose design is described here is self-contained.


\section{SYSTEM DECOMPOSITION}

\caption{System Structure}\label{SystemStructure}
\end{table}

The items to be developed as part of the Compliance Tool are shown in {\bf bold font} in the table.
For present purposes, it is convenient to group these items under three headings:
{\em User Interface}, covering the Basic and Custom HCI; {\em Compliance Notation Processing}, including Z and SPARK extraction and the toolkit extension; and {\em Custom Proof Facilities}.
These are discussed further in sections \ref{UserInterface}, \ref{ComplianceNotationProcessing} and \ref{CustomProofFacilities} below.
This grouping allows commonality between the functions to be exploited in the design.



\subsection{User Interface}\label{UserInterface}
\subsubsection{Basic HCI}
The Basic HCI subsystem is to be a simple customisation of the {\Product} X/Motif interface to cater for the new languages to be processed.
	
\subsubsection{Custom HCI}
TBS (this aspect of the design work is scheduled for later in the development and this document will then be updated).

\subsection{Compliance Notation Processing}\label{ComplianceNotationProcessing}

The SPARK program extractor takes Compliance Notation and produces a SPARK program which can be subsequently checked with the SPARK Examiner and compiled with an Ada Compiler.
The Z document extractor takes Compliance Notation and produces a Z document.
The Z toolkit extensions  comprise a small Z specification on which the Z document extraction depends (since it supplies typing information for objects which may be referenced in the extracted Z document, and {\Product} will be used to enforce type-correctness of all Z as it is generated.).
These three items are treated together as a single subsystem in this High Level Design.
This subsystem is itself further divided into subsystems and is described in further detail in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/HLD503}.

Sections \ref{ComplianceNotationInput}-\ref{ZToolkitExtensions} below give an overview of the subsystems identified  in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/HLD503} and discuss the rationale behind the design.

\subsubsection{Compliance Notation Input}\label{ComplianceNotationInput}

Both the Z and SPARK extractors have a considerable amount of common functionality in the lexical analysis, parsing and conversion of Compliance Notation.
Since it is required to supply a capability for Compliance Notation scripts to be presented and processed one clause at a time, it is sensible to have the processing which is common to both Z and SPARK extraction performed once per clause and then have the specific processing be performed by functions operating on a common intermediate representation of the Compliance Notation script. 

The common functionality will be referred to as the {\em Compliance Notation Input} subsystem.

Entering (correct) Compliance Notation into the Tool causes the intermediate representation of the Compliance Notation script to be stored internally in the Compliance Tool.
The generation of the Z Document and the SPARK program can be obtained readily from the intermediate represention.
Entry of syntactically incorrect Compliance Notation causes appropriate diagnostics to be reported to the user.

Compliance Notation comprises a sequence of web clauses interspersed with English Text and this constitutes a literate script.
The web clauses are processed by the Compliance Tool and the English text is ignored.
The web clause is the basic unit of recognition for the Compliance Tool.
The clauses which constitute Z syntax (i.e., Z paragraphs) can be processed by {\Product} already.
Additional support is required to process the other kinds of web clause (e.g., SPARK programs, refined-by statements).
The processing of web clauses to produce an abstract representation comprises the following functions:

\begin{description}

\item[\bf Clause Recognition]
The facilities provided by {\Product} give a uniform framework for the special markup required to identify the Web clauses in the literate script.

When a web clause is presented to the Compliance Tool, the markup causes a {\Product} subsystem called the Reader/Writer to be invoked.
The Reader/Writer is, in effect, a preprocessor for Standard ML intended to permit the use of Standard ML as a metalanguage for an extensible range of object languages.
The Reader/Writer is set up to arrange for the contents of a web clause to be passed on to the subsequent phases of Compliance Notation processing.

The set-up for the Z paragraph alternative for a web clause can be the same as the usual set-up for {\ProductZ} processing and so these can use the existing markup defined for {\ProductZ}.
Other sorts of clause are handled by a markup sequence defined for the purpose.


\item[\bf Lexical Analysis]
Web clauses are lexically analysed using the Compliance Notation lexical analyser. This provides a lexical representation based on Compliance Notation lexical classes for input into the Compliance Notation parser.


\item[\bf Parsing]
The lexical representation of a web clause is parsed and produces an abstract representation of the Compliance Notation in addition to building up an environment for subsequently producing the Z document if this should be requested.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Z Generation}
A data structure representing the Z document is generated as part of the intermediate representation of the Compliance Notation script. Each of the parsed web clauses is stored in the {\Product} theory database and the Z document environment is modified as each web clause is entered. Generation of Z for subsequent output is done during the process of parsing. The details of this process are specified in \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/4}.

Note that extraction of the Z document into a file is not necessary for proof work or other analysis (e.g. browsing). The {\Product} theory database contains the same representation of the Z document as would be produced by loading it as a {\ProductZ} script in the usual way.

\subsubsection{SPARK Generation}
The SPARK program is generated from the abstract representation by recursively passing over an abstract representation of the literate script, filling in the k-slots.

\subsubsection{Z and SPARK Output}
Once the SPARK program has been produced in the abstract form, it may be ``pretty-printed'' either on screen or to a file.
Likewise, the Z document can be produced by invoking a function to write the Z paragraphs and the verification conditions on screen or to a file in the order and format suggested in \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/4}.

\subsubsection{Z Toolkit Extensions}\label{ZToolkitExtensions}
The Z Toolkit Extensions of \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/6} comprise Z definitions which need only to be stored in a {\Product-Z} theory in the usual way.


\subsection{Custom Proof Facilities}\label{CustomProofFacilities}
TBS (this aspect of the design work is scheduled for later in the development and this document will then be updated).

\section{DATA STORAGE AND FORMATS}
\subsection{Input Files}
Compliance Notation literate scripts are represented as {\Product} literate scripts.
The markup for Z paragraphs, web clauses etc., uses the mechanisms described in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR001}.
Literate scripts are stored as text files and may be edited with an ordinary text editor.
Normally, a 256-bit character set is used for special symbols in the scripts;
however, a {\Product} utility may be used to convert to and from a representation using ASCII keywords for the non-ASCII symbols.


\subsection{Output Files}
The Z document is a {\Product} literate script.

The SPARK program is a text file and contains no special markup.

\subsection{Compliance Notation}

\subsubsection{Background: the {\Product} Theory Hierarchy}

In {\Product}, the axioms, definitions and (proved) theorems which represent the results of specification and proof work are organised into a hierarchy of named {\em theories}.
This theory hierarchy is a directed acyclic graph with root a theory $min$ which introduces the primitive constants of the {\ProductHOL} logic.
The theory hierarchy determines the scope of the axioms, definitions and theorems in each theory: a definition in a theory $t$, say, is only in scope in theories which can be reached from $t$ in the directed graph.
The {\ProductZ} support provides a particular theory hierarchy culminating in a theory $z\_library$ which supplies a scope in which all of the Z toolkit is available.

The organisation of a specification within the theory hierarchy is defined by metalanguage commands which name the theories introduced and define their place in the hierarchy.
The system maintains a notion of {\em current theory}:
during specification work the current theory is the one in which new definitions and axioms are stored;
during proof work, the current theory defines the definitions and axioms which are available for reasoning;
when a new theory is introduced it becomes the current theory and it has one parent which is the previous current theory.

For example, the following sets up a typical lozenge-shaped organisation within the theory hierarchy.

{\small
=SML
open_theory"z_library";		(* current theory now z_library *)
new_theory"A";			(* introduces A; parents(A) = {z_library} *)
¹Z
a ¦ [x, y: ú]			(* schema definition stored in A *)
°
=SML
new_theory"B";			(* introduces B; parents(B) = {A}; current theory now B *)
¹Z
b ¦ [a; z: ú]			(* schema definition stored in B *)
°
=SML
open_theory"A";		(* current theory becomes A *)
new_theory"C";			(* introduces C; parents(B) = {A}; current theory now C *)
¹Z
c ¦ [a; w: ú]			(* schema definition stored in C *)
°
=SML
new_theory"D";			(* introduces D; parents(D) = {C}; current theory now D *)
new_parent"B";			(* parents(D) = {B, C} *)
¹Z
d ¦ [b; c]			(* schema definition stored in D *)
°
}
In order to facilitate experimentation with the contents of a theory which has children, {\Product} provides a function $duplicate\_theory$ which creates a new theory which is a copy of an existing theory except with no children.
This feature can also be used to take a checkpoint on the state of a theory under development.

\subsubsection{Representing the Compliance Notation}
As a Compliance Notation literate script is processed, an intermediate representation of it is built up within {\Product}.
From time to time at the user's request, this intermediate representation is used to write out the SPARK program or the Z document to a file.
It is convenient to have the intermediate representation mapped into the {\Product} theory hierarchy so as to reflect the modular structure of the SPARK program.
The DRA specifications \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/2,DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/4} presuppose that the Z documents will be organised into ``modules'' and the use made of these suggests that each module should correspond to a {\Product} theory.

In addition to its logical content, a {\Product} theory provides programmable storage for so-called user data.
Despite the name, this is intended for use in {\Product} applications for storing application-specific information.
For example, it is used for information such as operator fixity whose form is specific to a particular object language (such as {\ProductZ}).
For the Compliance Tool, the user data component of the theory provides a natural  home for the various environments used in generating the Z and SPARK documents.

The mapping of the intermediate representation onto the {\Product} hierarchy is best described in terms of the Compliance Notation language constructs which cause new theories to be introduced.
Table \ref{IntermediateRepresentation} summarises the mapping.
The various environments referred to in the table are those defined in \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/4}.
In order to give a clearer structure to the design a theory is allocated for each Ada compilation unit.
A theory is also allocated for each literate script, this contains the Z paragraphs in the script together with the VCs and other Z fragments produced by the algorithm of \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/4}.
In the table, the names of the theories is indicated using, for example, ``{\em package}'' to stand for the name of the package in question.
``{\em script}'' refers to a name to be associated with the literate script itself.

In table \ref{IntermediateRepresentation}, the phrase ``Z fragments generated'' by a compilation unit is used to refer to VCs and the Z paragraphs corresponding to constant and type declarations.
These are stored in the theory corresponding to the compilation unit and are copied to the output Z document as appropriate.
Some economies of space could be made by making more use of $new\_parent$  than is implied by \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/WP/4} (which only asks for import/export features to be used in the implementation of subunits).
