% Evolving BiBTeX database for the DAZ project. Supplements the
% database ``fmu.bib'' provided with ProofPower.
%
% Organisation
% %%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% The organisation and entry types are:
%
%    1. string definitions
%    2. journal articles and books  (incollection, article or book type)
%    3. external technical papers   (projdoc or phdthesis type)
%    4. local technical papers      (projdoc type)
%    5. IED project documents       (projdoc type)
%
% The `projdoc' entry type is defined in the associated .bst file
% ``fmu.bst'' supplied with ProofPower.
%
% Conventions
% %%%%%%%%%%%
%
% These are evolving.
%
% Keys:
%        For journal articles and books use the principal author's surname
%        with the last two digits of the year of publication
%        appended for that author's first article or book that year.
%        For subsequent works in the same year append `b', `c', ... .
%
%        For external and local technical papers use the identity.
%        If this is inappropriate (e.g. if the
%        external reference identity you want to appear in bibliographies
%        contains spaces) use a lower case abbreviation of the identity.
%        If that is inappropriate (e.g. if there is no suitable document
%        reference number to use as an identity), then invent an identity
%        based on the author's name as for a book. In this last case
%        you can explicitly set identity="", if you don't want the
%        invented identity to appear in the bibliography entry.
%
% Optional fields to fill in:
%
%        For `article' type give `volume' and `number' if appropriate and
%        give `pages' if at all possible.
%        For `incollection' type give `editor' and `pages' if appropriate.
%
%        For `projdoc' `identity' will normally be the same as the key
%        (apart from capitalisation) and may be omitted since the
%        style file will output the key as it was typed in the document
%        in its place. It need only be given if it contains underscores
%        or or other special LaTeX characters which need to be escaped,
%        (such characters should be omitted from the key),
%        or if you wish to suppress or vary its appearance in the actual
%        bibliographies and its use as a sort key (e.g. for an external
%        technical document, see harwood89b and luckham79 for examples.).
%
% 1. string definitions:
%
% We use these for names of common journals and publishers and for
% local authors etc.
