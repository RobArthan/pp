\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document provides the user with an interface to all the functions required to operate the compliance tool and is written in response to \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/HLD503}.

\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a signature which comprises the functions necessary for a user to operate the compliance tool. It supports the following functionality:
\begin{description}
\item
Specify a new literate script
\item
Generate a SPARK program, either into the {\Product} journal window or into a file.
\item
Generate a Z document, either into the journal window or a file.
\item
Invoke a navigation system to map between VCs and the web clauses from which they originate. 
\end{description}
\subsubsection{Known Deficiencies}
None known.
\subsection{Possible Enhancements}
None.

\section{THE SIGNATURE}
=DOC
signature ÛComplianceToolÝ  = sig
=DESCRIBE
This is the signature for the commands which a user requires to operate the compliance tool.
=ENDDOC
\section{WORKING WITH THE EXCEPTION LOG}
=DOC
val Ûprint_exception_logÝ  : string -> bool;
val Ûoutput_exception_logÝ : {script : string, out_file : string} -> bool;
val Ûdelete_exception_logÝ : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
{\it print\_exception\_log} causes the exception log for the named script to be printed to standard output.
{\it output\_exception\_log}  prints the exception log to a file.
Both of these functions return true if some exceptions have been logged for the script.
If no exceptions have been logged a message to that effect is output and the functions return false.
Both functions will raise an exception if the named script has not been processed.

{\it delete\_exception\_log} deletes the exception log for the named script.
=ENDDOC
=FAILURE
516101	No exceptions have been logged for script ?0
516102	The following exceptions have been logged for script ?0:
=TEX
\section{CREATING NEW LITERATE SCRIPTS}
=DOC
val Ûnew_scriptÝ : {name : string} -> unit
val Ûnew_script1Ý :
	{name : string, library_theories : string list} -> unit
val Ûnew_continuation_scriptÝ : {name : string} -> unit
val Ûnew_continuation_script1Ý :
	{name : string, library_theories : string list} -> unit
val Ûdelete_scriptÝ : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
{\it new\_script} takes as an argument the name of a literate script. It and creates a new theory of the indicated name, into which the Z document generated by the subsequent literate script is placed.
The data structure containing the SPARK program is set to its initial empty value.

{\it new\_script1} acts the same as {\it new\_script} except that its list
of library theories will be made the parents of the script theory,
and any theory produced during processing the script.	

{\it new\_continuation\_script} and {\it new\_continuation\_script} are
just like {\it new\_script} and {\it new\_script1}, except that the data
structure containing the SPARK program is retained.

{\it delete\_script} removes a script from the Compliance Tool state together with any associated
theories and other items in the state dependent on the script so that the script can be reloaded. 
It prints a report of what has been deleted.
=ENDDOC
\section{GENERATING THE ADA PROGRAM}
=DOC
val Ûprint_ada_programÝ : string -> unit
val Ûoutput_ada_programÝ : {script : string, out_file : string} -> unit
=DESCRIBE
The call $print\_spark\_program\;name$ generates and prints the Ada program contained
in the script with the specified name.
A minus sign may be used for the name to specify the current script.
The Ada program is created by filling in the k-slots and specification statements in a literate script with their expansions.
The result is printed on the standard output channel in Ada syntax such that it could be subsequently compiled using an Ada compiler.

{\it output\_spark\_program} does the same as {\it print\_spark\_program} but allows the user to specify a file to which the program will then be written. 
=USES
For example, if a literate script called ``primes'' has just been entered into the {\daztool}  then the following command will output the corresponding Ada to a file called $primes.ada$.

\begin{verbatim}
output_ada_program{script = "-", out_file="primes.ada"}
\end{verbatim}

=ENDDOC
\section{GENERATING A Z DOCUMENT}
=DOC
val Ûprint_z_documentÝ : string -> unit
val Ûoutput_z_documentÝ : {script : string, out_file : string} -> unit
val Ûget_script_theoriesÝ : string -> string list
=DESCRIBE
$print\_z\_document$ prints the Z document from the named script to the standard output. The listing is in a format suitable for its re-entry into a {\Product} session.

$output\_z\_program$ is similar to $print\_z\_document$, but the the Z document is written to the named output file $out\_file$.

=USES
For example, if a literate script called ``primes'' has been entered into the {\daztool}  then the following command will output the corresponding Z document to a file called $primes.zdoc$.

\begin{verbatim}
output_z_document{script="primes", out_file="primes.zdoc"}
\end{verbatim}

{\em get\_script\_theories n} returns a list of all the {\Product} theories associated with the Compliance Notation script {\em n}.
=ENDDOC

\section{NAVIGATION}

=DOC
val Ûbrowse_vcsÝ : unit -> unit
=DESCRIBE
On systems with support for X/Windows and Motif enabled,
this command invokes an interactive browsing tool for mapping VCs onto web clauses, and vice versa.
=FAILURE
516201	The VC browser is not available on this ProofPower system
=ENDDOC

\section{GENERATING AN EDIT SCRIPT FOR HYPERTEXT}

=DOC
val Ûoutput_hypertext_edit_scriptÝ : {out_file : string} -> unit
=DESCRIBE
This function produces an edit script from a processed literate script. The edit script is placed in a file with name $out\_file$.

The edit script will introduce hypertext links between specification statements or K-Slots, and their corresponding expansion paragraphs. 
=ENDDOC

\section{SUBSTITUTION IN VCS}
=DOC
(* Flag Ûcn_use_let_in_vcsÝ - boolean control, default false *)
=DESCRIBE
This is the name of flag (see {\it set\_flag} in \REFERENCE).
The flag controls the way substitution of expressions for variables is treated during VC generation.

If the flag is false (the default), then the substitution is carried out using the HOL $subst$ function and then conversions are used to transform the result into Z: this results in a Z term in which the variables have actually been replaced by their substitutes, and declarations and other constructs have been adjusted as necessary to avoid variable capture.

If the flag is set true (using $set\_flag$), then a Z $let$ construct is used to give the semantics of substitution without actually replacing any variables with their substitutes.
This can help to abbreviate the VC and make its structure clearer.
=ENDDOC
\section{DIAGNOSTICS FOR TYPE-CHECKING}
=DOC
(* Flag Ûcn_show_typing_contextÝ - boolean control, default false *)
=DESCRIBE
This is the name of a flag (see {\it set\_flag} in \REFERENCE).
It controls a diagnostic display which may be of help in understanding
problems with type-checking.

When set to true the flag will cause the tool to display
the typing context used when type-checking each Z expression
encountered in Compliance Notation clauses.
The display gives a list of the theories that are in scope (omitting {\it z\_library}
and its ancestors) and a list of the variables that are have their
type fixed by the context (e.g., variables corresponding to SPARK program variables).

This flag is primarily a diagnostic aid for developers of the tool, but
may be of help to a general user in some difficult cases.
=ENDDOC
\section{PRETTY-PRINTING OF THE SPARK PROGRAM}
=DOC
(* Ûcase_of_ada_keywordsÝ - string control, default "lower" *)
=DESCRIBE
This is the name of a string control (see {\it set\_string\_control} in \REFERENCE).
It controls the case of Ada reserved words in the output from {\it print\_ada\_program}
and {\it output\_ada\_program}.
There are three allowed values for the string control: {\tt "upper"}, {\tt "lower"} and
{\tt "as input"}.
The values {\tt "upper"} and {\tt "lower"} makes the tool generate upper-case and lower-case reserved words respectively;
the value {\tt "as input"} makes the tool use the same case for a reserved
word as was used at its first appearance in the original Compliance Notation script.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
(* Ûcn_automatic_line_splittingÝ - integer control declared by new_int_control, default 80 *)
(* Ûcn_tab_widthÝ - integer control declared by new_int_control, default 2 *)
(* Ûcn_left_marginÝ - integer control declared by new_int_control, default 0 *)
=DESCRIBE
These controls define parameters for output from 
$format\_web\_clause$,  
$print\_web\_clause$,
$print\_spark\_program$,
$output\_spark\_program$ and
{\it strings\_from\_fmt1}.

These functions always split lines at logical break points (e.g. at semicolons at the end of statements).
However, they will also split lines that are longer than the value set by the control
{\it cn\_automatic\_line\_spliting} 
(if it is non-zero), chosing to split at a syntactically allowed location.
If the control is set to 0 then no automatic line-splitting is done
(except in Z terms, which will be split during formatting to match the current line length setting).
The default value of the control is 80.

{\it cn\_tab\_width} controls the number of spaces used to indent a nested structure
such as the statement in the then part of an if statement. {\it cn\_left\_margin} specifies
an indentation to be applied on every line and is given in the units specified by {\it cn\_tab\_width}.
E.g., if {\it cn\_tab\_width} is 2 and {\it cn\_left\_margin} is 4, every line will be indented by at
least 8 spaces, and each nested structure will be indented 2 spaces more than the structure
immediately containing it.
=ENDDOC

\section{STORAGE OF Z TERMS}
=DOC
(* Flag Ûcn_compactify_termsÝ - boolean control, default true *)
=DESCRIBE
This is the name of a flag (see {\it set\_flag} in \REFERENCE).
It controls a feature for optimising the memory space  
occupied by the Z terms stored in the internal data structures of the Compliance Tool.

Since this space optimisation involves some processing overhead,
it is optional, but it is enabled by default.
The space optimisation can be disabled by
setting the flag {\it cn\_compactify\_terms} to {\it false} and
enabled by setting it to {\it true}.
=ENDDOC
\section{CONTROLLING THE PARAGRAPH RECOGNISER}
=DOC
(* Flag Ûcn_syntax_check_onlyÝ - boolean control, default false *)
=DESCRIBE
This is the name of a flag (see {\it set\_flag} in \REFERENCE).
It allows you to carry out check that a script complies
with the syntax of the Compliance Notation.

When the flag is set false, all stages of processing
are carried out on each Compliance Notation clause entered.

When the flag is set true, all processing relating to
the production of VCs and the Z paragraphs that
support them is suppressed. The Ada program may still
be produced and all the literate programming language
features may be used.

Note that this flag only controls processing of Compliance Notation clauses.
Z paragraphs will be processed regardless of the value of this flag.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
(* Flag Ûcn_stop_on_exceptionsÝ - boolean control, default true *)
=DESCRIBE
This flag controls the handling of exceptions when a Compliance Notation clause
is processed. If the flag is true, then if processing a Compliance Notation clause
will cause ML exceptions when errors are detected. If the flag is false, the an error message
will be printed but an exception will not be raised. In either case, the error message will
be recorded in a log that can be inspected using {\it print\_exception\_log}, q.v.

The processing of Z paragraphs is not affected by this flag.
=ENDDOC
\section{CONTROLLING THE GENERATION OF DOMAIN CONDITIONS}
=DOC
(* cn_domain_conds: integer control; 3 values allowed as follows *)
val Ûcn_no_domain_condsÝ : int;
val Ûcn_standard_domain_condsÝ : int;
val Ûcn_all_domain_condsÝ : int;

=DESCRIBE
{\it cn\_domain\_conds} is the name of an integer control
(see {\it set\_int\_control} in \REFERENCE).
It controls the generation of domain conditions, i.e., additional hypotheses that
are added to VCs to help make them provable in cases where the compliance argument
depends for its validity on the program not raising an exception.
The control should be given one of the three
integer values given by the three ML bindings above. The effect
of the control is shown in the following table:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{3in}|}\hline
=INLINEFT
cn_no_domain_conds
=TEX
& No domain conditions are generated.\\\hline
=INLINEFT
cn_standard_domain_conds
=TEX
& Only domain conditions corresponding to exceptions that are guaranteed by ALRM
\cite{AJPO83} are generated. \\\hline
=INLINEFT
cn_all_domain_conds
=TEX
& Domain conditions are generated as for
=INLINEFT
cn_standard_domain_conds
=TEX
\ together with domain conditions corresponding to real arithmetic exceptions.\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

=ENDDOC
\section{CONTROLLING THE GENERATION OF SPARK SYNTAX WARNINGS}

=DOC
(* Ûcn_spark_syntax_warningsÝ - integer control declared by new_flag; default false *)
=DESCRIBE
Thiis flag controls whether or not Ada comments are to be inserted in the output
produced by the functions
$format\_web\_clause$,  
$print\_web\_clause$,
$print\_spark\_program$, and
$output\_spark\_program$
to warn about uses of Ada syntax that is not in the SPARK subset.
Note that the checks are only made on the Ada concrete syntax, ignoring comments, there is
no checking that required SPARK annotations are present or correct and no context-sensitive
checks are made.
The checks are based on the syntax given in John Barnes' book {\it High Integrity Ada The SPARK Approach}
ISBN 0-201-17517-7.
=ENDDOC


\section{CONTROLLING THE RECOGNITION OF SPARK ANNOTATIONS}

=DOC
(* Flag Ûcn_ignore_spark_annotationsÝ - boolean control, default false *)
=DESCRIBE
This flag controls the treatment of Ada comments having the form of SPARK annotations,
i.e., comments beginning with ``\verb|--#|''.
If the flag is false, the default, then such comments are treated as SPARK annotations and
may only appear in syntactic positions where the SPARK syntax accepts an annotation.
The annotations are remembered for inclusion in the output when the program is printed.
If the flag is true, then such comments are treated as ordinary Ada comments and ignored.

=ENDDOC



\subsection{SUPPORT FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAYS}
=DOC
val Ûarray_agg_defÝ : int -> unit
=DESCRIBE
This function is used to generate the definitions that support multidimensional array
aggregates. These definitions are built-in for arrays of up to 20 dimensions, so you
do not need to use this function unless you have array aggregates of more than 20
dimensions. The function should be called after first opening either the theory ``cn''
or the cache theory for your database.
=FAILURE
508059	the argument to array_agg_def must be at least 2
=ENDDOC

\section{INITIALISATION AND SHUTDOWN}
This interface is not for the end-user:
=SML
val Ûpending_reset_cn_stateÝ : unit -> unit -> unit;
=TEX

\section{EPILOGUE}

=SML
end (* signature ComplianceTool *);
=TEX

\section{TEST POLICY}
The functions in this document are used to invoke interactive tools and are not appropriate for off-line testing. Therefore there are no corresponding module tests.

These are to be tested during system/integration tests as discussed in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/HLD502}.
