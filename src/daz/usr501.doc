\pagebreak
\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document is (a provisional and preliminary version of) the User Guide for the Compliance Tool.
It forms part of the response to the requirements for user documentation in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DEF501}.


\Note{Notes such as this one are used for comments about the likely content of the final User Guide. These notes will subsequently be removed.}

\subsection{Area Covered}

Once the Compliance Tool is installed on the user's workstation, by following the procedure described in the Installation Guide, this User Guide should enable the user to undertake the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Loading a Compliance Notation script into the tool.
\item
Generation of the SPARK program from a script;
\item
Generation of the Z document from a script;
\item
Using the VC Browser to examine the VCs and the Compliance Notation constructs which gave rise to them.
\item
Editing and checking of a script;
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assumptions}

This User Guide is {\em not} intended to be an introduction to the Z language, or the Compliance Notation or to the use of {\Product} to prepare the Z parts of a script.

A tool-independent description of the Compliance Notation is given in \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/n/1}.
The {\ProductZ} tutorial, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR010}, gives an introduction to the user of {\Product} for specification and proof in Z.

The {\Product} user documentation is supplied as part of the {\Product} release  included with the Compliance Tool and is available for on-line reference.

The user interface to the tool described in this document is a Motif application  running under the X Windows System.
Users who are unfamiliar with X or Motif should consult their local or supplier's documentation or expertise for further guidance (e.g. see \cite{sun92a}).

\subsection{Introduction}
Sections \ref{INTRO} to \ref{WindowLayout} of this document constitute the User Guide for the Compliance Tool.
In the present preliminary version, these mainly serve to expose the design ideas.


\Note{As the design evolves, the descriptions in these sections will be developed into a user-oriented description of the various facilities.}

\section{INTRODUCTION TO THE COMPLIANCE TOOL}\label{INTRO}

The Compliance Tool supports a notation for demonstrating the compliance of Ada programs with Z specifications.
The Ada parts of the notation belong to the SPARK subset of Ada and will be referred to as SPARK in the rest of this document.
The Compliance Notation is described in \cite{DRA/CIS/CSE3/SWI/n/1}.

Compliance Notation is prepared and presented in literate scripts containing a mixture of narrative text, Z and SPARK.
Special notations are provided for two main purposes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
to allow the SPARK program to be presented and documented in an order independent of that prescribed by the SPARK syntax (in a similar fashion to Knuth's Web system \cite{Knuth84a});
\item
to allow the behaviour of the SPARK code to be formally specified in Z (using a style based on Morgan's refinement calculus \cite{Morgan90}).
\end{enumerate}

The Compliance Tool described in this document is an application of the {\Product} specification and proof tool.
The tool provides all the facilities offered by {\Product} for developing specifications and proofs in HOL and Z and for preparing high quality printed output via the {\LaTeX} system.



\pagebreak
\section{GETTING STARTED}

The process of using of the Compliance Tool to process a script is very similar to that of using {\Product} to process a Z specification.
Indeed, the Z paragraphs in a Compliance Notation script are processed using the usual {\Product} mechanisms and the constructs peculiar to the Compliance Notation are processed in the same style.

Simple use of the tool to process existing scripts does not require any great familiarity of {\Product}.
Using the tool to create new scripts or edit existing ones requires some familiarity with the preparation of Z specifications using {\Product} (as described in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR011}).
Sections \ref{Databases} and \ref{StartingXpp} below explain how to start an interactive session with the tool for either of these levels of use.
Section \ref{WindowLayout} gives a brief overview of the main graphical features of the tool.


\subsection{{\Product} Databases}\label{Databases}
As always with a {\Product} application, to use the Compliance Tool you must first pick the {\Product} database with which you wish to work.
A {\Product} database is a file which holds code and data recording the results of work with {\Product}.
These databases are organised in a hierarchy.
To run the Compliance Tool, you use a database which is a descendant in this hierarchy of the database {\tt pp\_daz}.
This database, held in a file called
{\tt sun4bin/sun4pp\_daz.db} in the {\Product} installation directory, contains the code and data required to process Compliance Notation.
If you are starting from scratch, you would create a suitable database, say called {\tt mydatabase}, using a UNIX command line such as:

\begin{verbatim}
        pp_make_database -p pp_daz mydatabase
\end{verbatim}

This creates an empty database, which you will generally refer to as `{\tt myapp}' when using the system.
The database is held in a file called `{\tt sun4myapp.db}' and this is the name you would use to carry out UNIX file operations on the database, e.g., to delete it with the UNIX command `{\tt rm}'.

\subsection{Starting {\tt xpp}}\label{StartingXpp}
To start an interactive session with the Compliance Notation tool, you use the UNIX command {\tt xpp}.
{tt xpp} comprises a custom editor for working on your scripts together with a command interface for executing {\Product} commands and for loading Z and Compliance Notation constructs into the database.

The {\tt xpp} command has options to identify the file containing the script you want edit and to give the {\Product} command options (including the database to use).
To begin work on the script `{\tt wrk001.doc} with the database `{\tt mydatabase}', you might use the UNIX command line:

\begin{verbatim}
        xpp -file wrk001.doc -command pp -d mydatabase
\end{verbatim}
 

This will create a Motif window similar to the one shown in figure \ref{fig1}.
This is referred to as the {\tt xpp} Main Window.
If you omit the {\tt -command} option, then you will get a so-called edit-only session, in which the lower part of the window will be missing.

\pagebreak
\subsection{Window Layout}\label{WindowLayout}
This section describes briefly the main elements of the {\tt xpp} Main Window.
Further information may be obtained either from the tool's help system or from the {\Product} documentation.

In overview, the top part of the window acts as an editor for literate scripts.
Material from the editor can be transferred into the {\ProductML} system for processing (e.g. to type check a specification paragraph or initiate a proof step).
The journal of the transactions with {\Product} occupies the bottom part of the window.
Figure \ref{fig1} also shows a popup window (in this case a palette of special symbols).
The size and relative positioning of all the windows can be adjusted using standard Motif techniques.

Sections \ref{MenuBar} to \ref{JournalWindow} below describe the principal features of the {\tt xpp} Main Window.

\subsubsection{Menu Bar}\label{MenuBar}
The menu bar is at the top of the window shown in figure \ref{fig1}.
The menus are all pulldown menus operated in the usual Motif fashion.
The functions they perform are briefly described below.

\paragraph{File Menu}
This menu is for common file operations including: loading and saving the literate script; creating a new literate script; deleting a file.

\paragraph{Tools Menu}
This menu is used to create popup windows to perform various tasks.
An example is the palette window shown in figure \ref{fig1}.

\paragraph{Edit Menu}
This menu provides script editing operations: cut, copy and paste and undo.
\paragraph{Command Menu}\label{CommandMenu}

This menu is primarily used to cause text from the script window to be executed by the {\ProductML} system.
It also provides various control functions for the {\ProductML} system.

\paragraph{Help Menu}\label{HelpMenu}
This menu provides help on various topics.


\subsubsection{Script Window}\label{ScriptWindow}
The Script Window is the upper large Motif text window in the {\tt xpp} Main Window.
It provides a general purpose editor for viewing and modifying scripts.
In  figure \ref{fig1}, a Compliance Notation script containing the Z definition of a set called $primed$ and a SPARK procedure called $primes$ is being displayed in the Script Window.

Part of the Script Window in figure \ref{fig1} is hidden behind a window containing a ``palette'' of symbols.
This palette has been selected from the Tools Menu and can be used to enter the symbols into the literate script.
Pushing one of the buttons on the palette causes the symbol to appear in the document as if it had been typed at  the keyboard.

Note that the Z and SPARK constructs in the Script Window are delimited using special mark-up sequences:
{\ShowAllImages ``$¹Z$'', ``$¹CN$'' and ``°''}.
A tool called the ``Templates Tool'' is available from the Tools Menu allowing easy entry of these mark-up sequences.

\subsubsection{Journal Window}\label{JournalWindow}
The Journal Window is the lower large Motif text window in the {\tt xpp} Main Window.
When {\Product} commands are executed the resulting responses from the {\Product} system are displayed in the Journal Window.
The Journal Window is a read-only text window --- you cannot alter its contents by typing into it.

In \ref{fig1}, the user has just issued a command to process the procedure $primes$.
This is done by selecting the procedure and its delimiting mark-up sequences in the Script Window and then using the ``execute'' item in the Command Menu.
The absence of error messages in the Journal Window and the prompt ``$:>$'' for a further command indicate successful processing.

\section{COMPLIANCE NOTATION FUNCTIONS}
Sections \ref{Loading} to \ref{Editing} below describe basic use of the main functions of the Compliance Notation tool.

\subsection{Loading a Script}\label{Loading}
\Note{This section will describe the use of the Command Line Tool, ``{\tt docsml}'' and ``$use\_file$'' to load an existing (correct) script}.

\subsection{Generating the SPARK Program}\label{SPARKProgram}
\Note{This section will describe the use of the  ``$output\_spark\_program$'' to produce the SPARK program}.
\subsection{Generating the Z document}\label{ZDocument}
\Note{This section will describe the use of the  ``$output\_z\_document$'' to produce the Z document}.
\subsection{Using the VC Browser}\label{VCBrowser}
Figure \ref{fig2} gives another example of an {\tt xpp} Main Window.
In this example, the user has used the Command Line Tool to issue commands to load an entire script into the tool and then display the Z document in the Journal Window.
The Search-and-Replace Tool has been used to carry out a textual search in the Script Window for the refinement step which introduced the VC at the end of the Z document.

Using an editor to correlate the script with the VCs can be a useful technique but is often time consuming.
The VC Browser gives an easy way of examining the VCs and relating them to the Compliance Notation clauses which produced them.

\subsection{Editing a Script}\label{Editing}

\Note{This section will refer to the {\Product} documentation for the basic use of the script editor and describe the custom templates tool for the Compliance Notation}.

\section{{\ProductML} COMMAND REFERENCE}
\Note{This section will document the metalanguage commands the user needs to know as described in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD516} in the format of the {\Product} Reference Manual.}
