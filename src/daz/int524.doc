\section{INTRODUCTION}\label{INTRODUCTION}
This document is intended to provide integration tests to cover
the enhancements undertaken under the programme
of enhancements carried out in early 2004. See \cite{LEMMA1/HOL/REQ002}
for the detailed specification of the enhancements.

The interim releases of the Compliance Tool have been
fully regression-tested and the new features have been module-
and integration-tested to a certain extent by the existing tests.
This document provides specific integration tests to
complete the coverage. 

It was noted during this round of enhancements that the example
material in  \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/USR503} and  \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/WRK513}
was only being tested implicitly during the documentation build. The make file
entry for these tests includes those documents to ensure it is run when tests are run as well.

\section{PREAMBLE}
Load the test harness.

=TEX
Function to clean up before doing a test.

=SML

	val err_scrs =map fst (CNZGenerator.get_exception_logs());
        in      map del_thy thys;
	map delete_exception_log err_scrs;
	open_theory"cn";
	set_pc "cn1"
        end;    ()
