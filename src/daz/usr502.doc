\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

This document is a supplement to the guide entitled ``{\Product} Installation and Operation'' \cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR007}. The {\daztool} software is provided with your release of {\Product}. The installation of {\daztool} requires that you have already completed the installation of {\Product}.

To perform the installation and testing of {\daztool}, turn to chapter \ref{INSTALL}.

\section{Contents of This Document}

Chapter \ref{RELCONTENT} describes the contents of the release tape.

Chapter \ref{INSTALL} describes the installation of the {\daztool} software.

Section \ref{INSTALLTEST} describes the installation confidence test.

Chapter \ref{USAGE} describes how to get started with the {\daztool} software.

Chapter \ref{LIMITATIONS} describes the limitations of the {\daztool} software in the current release.


\chapter{RELEASE CONTENTS}
\label{RELCONTENT}

The {\daztool} software is overlaid on the directory structure of {\Product}. This section describes the files in the {\Product} directory structure that are specific to {\daztool}.

The tape which was used to load {\Product} already contains the {\daztool} software and documentation. There is no need to load in any further software from tape -- it is already present in your installation.

The following sections describe the files in the directory structure which are specific to the {\daztool}.

\section{Installation Directory}


The installation directory is the same as the installation directory used when installing {\Product}. This is set by the PPINSTALLDIR shell variable. There are no specific {\daztool} files in this directory. The {\daztool} software and documentation actually resides in subdirectories of \$PPINSTALLDIR.


\section{Binaries Directory}\label{BINDIR}

The directory $\$PPINSTALLDIR/\arch bin$ contains the {\daztool} database. When {\Product} is invoked with this database, the Compliance Tool facilities are available. 

\begin{table}[p]
\begin{center}

\def\LAB#1{\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}}#1\end{tabular}}

This is a sieveview file which is customized for {\daztool}. It differs from the {\Product} or {\ProductZ} sieve steering file in that it has additional entries for dealing with Compliance Notation.
It replaces the file of the same name set up when {\Product} is installed.

\section{DAZ Documentation Directory}\label{DAZDOCSDIR}
The directory {\tt ./dazdocs} contains the design documentation of the {\daztool}. An example Compliance Notation script is also provided and constitutes the basis for confidence testing of your configuration.

\chapter{INSTALLATION}\label{INSTALL}

In the following steps, it is assumed that you are running X/Motif window manager and that your default shell is the $Bourne$ shell (or one of its derivatives).

\begin{enumerate}
\item
The only installation step required is to create a working {\daztool} database. Login as the user which you used to install {\Product} and check that the shell variable PPINSTALLDIR is set to the location of your {\Product} installation. Then in a command tool, type the following commands.

\begin{verbatim}
cd $PPINSTALLDIR/sun4bin
pp_make_database -p pp_daz daz
\end{verbatim}


\end{enumerate}

\section{Running the Confidence Tests}\label{INSTALLTEST}

The following procedure constitutes the installation confidence test for the {\daztool}.


\begin{enumerate}

\item
Initially, in the installation directory, create a test directory and copy in an example literate script by typing the following:

\begin{verbatim}
mkdir daztest
cd daztest
cp ../dazdocs/wrk501.sml .
\end{verbatim}

\item
To get started, create a {\daztool} database and start up $xpp$ running a session of the {\daztool} on that database by typing the following into a command tool or $xterm$.

\begin{verbatim}
pp_make_database -p pp_daz dazinst
xpp -command pp -d dazinst &
\end{verbatim}


\item
You should now have a {\daztool} session running in the journal area of {\tt xpp}, displaying a banner giving start-of-session information, licensing information and the release number, followed by the {\daztool} prompt: ``{\tt :>}''. (The session may take a minute or so to get started.)

Start up a command line tool in {\tt xpp}, from its {\tt Tools} menu.

In the command line tool text area type:

\begin{verbatim}
use_file "wrk501";
\end{verbatim}
and hit the execute button.
This will process the literate script in the file $wrk501.sml$ which is the ``1000 Primes Example''.

The loading of the file should run to completion without error, which takes no longer than 5 minutes on a SPARCstation 1+.

\item

To print the SPARK program which is derived from this literate script, in the command line tool text area type:

\begin{verbatim}
print_spark_program();
\end{verbatim}
and hit the execute button.
This will display the SPARK program on the screen.

\item
To write the SPARK program to a file, in the command line type

\begin{verbatim}
output_spark_program{out_file="wrk501.ada"};
\end{verbatim}
and hit the execute button.
Using the $xpp$ File menu, you may load the file $wrk501.ada$ and have a look at the generated program.

\item
Generate the Z document from the literate script; to do this use the command line tool again and type into its text area the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
output_z_document{script="wrk501", out_file="wrk501.zed"};
\end{verbatim}
and hit the execute button.
Using the $xpp$ File menu, you may load the file $wrk501.zed$ and have a look at the generated Z document.

\item
Now load the Z document you have just generated back into the {\daztool}. From the $xpp$ Edit menu, restart the tool, and when the pop-up window asks for confirmation, hit the $OK$ button.

Next, bring up the command line tool, and type into it the following line:
\begin{verbatim}
use_file"wrk501.zed";
\end{verbatim}
and hit the execute button.

This will process the Z document in the file $wrk501.zdoc$ which we have just generated.

The loading of the file should run to completion without error.

\end{enumerate}

This completes the confidence tests and you may wish to delete the directory $daztest$ and its contents.

\chapter{NOTES ON GETTING STARTED}\label{USAGE}

\section{Invoking the Tool}\label{INVOKE}

The tool can be invoked by typing the following line into a command tool (e.g., $xterm$).
\begin{verbatim}
xpp -command pp -d daz &
\end{verbatim}

Using the tool is very similar to using {\ProductZ} and the reader is referred to {\ProductZ} user documentation.

\section{Trying an Example}

You may wish to try the ``1000 Primes Example'' to see how a literate script for the {\daztool} looks and how the tool behaves when the script is entered. If so, try the following.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Invoke the tool as described in section \ref{INVOKE}.

\item
Using the File menu, load the file $wrk501.doc$ which you will find in the $dazdocs$ directory.

\item
Using the xpp text selection facility and the execute command, load the formal text into the tool. The formal text includes Standard ML commands (which follow the =SML sieve directive), Z paragraphs, whose syntax is described in the Z user documentation of {\ProductZ}, and Compliance Notatation paragraphs.

In general Compliance Notation paragraphs are entered in documents using the paragraph introduction symbols, $¹CN$, at the beginning of a new line, and are terminated with the character $°$ on its own on a line.
The characters ¹, ° may be obtained from the palette of extended characters
or typed directly (as Meta+`(' and Meta+`)').

\item
When you have entered some of the script, you can try some of the commands documented in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/USR501}, and this will show you how the SPARK program and the Z document evolve during processing of the literate script.

\item
When you have done this, you may like to use the $wrk501.doc$ as a template for writing a new literate script. 

\end{enumerate}

\chapter{KNOWN LIMITATIONS}\label{LIMITATIONS}

The following is a list of known limitations with the current release of the {\daztool}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
The user documentation has not yet been supplied.
\item
Auxiliary Variables are not yet fully tested.
\item
Many of the checks (including checks for aliasing) are not yet made.
\item
The HCI Navigation facilities are not provided as part of this release.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{CHANGES IN RELEASE \release}\label{CHANGES}

Changes between two superseded releases are best commented
out by ``=IGN'' and judicious use of spaces at starts of lines.
This will aid their recovery if a ``long'' leap is required for some customer.
