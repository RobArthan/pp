\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

This document is a supplement to \INSTALLATION. The {\daztool} software is provided with your release of {\Product}. The installation of the {\daztool} requires that you have already completed the installation of {\Product}. See the {\tt README} files for more information.
To perform the installation and testing of {\daztool}, turn to chapter \ref{INSTALL}.

\section{Contents of This Document}

Chapter \ref{RELCONTENT} describes the contents of the binary and documentation distribution.

Chapter \ref{INSTALL} describes the installation of the {\daztool} software.

Section \ref{INSTALLTEST} describes the installation confidence test.

%Chapter \ref{LIMITATIONS} describes the limitations of the {\daztool} software in the current release.


\chapter{RELEASE CONTENTS}
\label{RELCONTENT}

The {\daztool} software is overlaid on the {\Product} installation directory. This section describes the files in the {\Product} installation directory that are specific to the {\daztool}.
Consult the files {\tt README} supplied with the distribution for more information on
loading the files from the distribution media.
The following sections describe the files in the directory structure which are specific to the {\daztool}.

\section{Installation Directory}


The installation directory is the same as the installation directory used when installing {\Product}. This is set by the PPINSTALLDIR shell variable. There are no specific {\daztool} files in this directory --- the {\daztool} software and documentation resides in subdirectories of \$PPINSTALLDIR.


\section{Binaries Directory}\label{BINDIR}

The directory \$PPINSTALLDIR/bin contains the {\daztool} database. When {\Product} is invoked with this database, the Compliance Tool facilities are available.
The binary files specific to the {\daztool} are described in table~\ref{BINDIRTAB}.

\begin{table}[p]

\section{Documentation Directory}\label{DAZDOCSDIR}
The directory {\tt ./doc} includes the design documentation of the {\daztool}. An example Compliance Notation script is also provided and constitutes the basis for confidence testing of your configuration.
The documentation files specific to the {\daztool} are described in table~\ref{DAZDOCSDIRTAB}.

\section{Application Defaults Directory}\label{APPDDIR}
The directory $./app-defaults$ is  used by Motif for defaults information,
and a sample defaults file for the Compliance Tool is provided.
The application default files specific to the {\daztool} are described in table~\ref{APPDDIRTAB}.

\section{Bitmaps Directory}\label{BITMAPSDIR}

The directory {\tt ./bitmaps} contains bitmaps which are used by the xpp tool to display the template selection box and any other bitmaps which \Product{} requires.
The bitmap files specific to the {\daztool} are described in table~\ref{BITMAPSDIRTAB}.


\chapter{INSTALLATION}\label{INSTALL}

In the following steps, it is assumed that you are running X and the Motif window manager and that your default shell is the $Bourne$ shell (or one of its derivatives).

\begin{enumerate}
\item
The only installation step required is to create a working {\daztool} database. Login as the user which you used to install {\Product} and check that the shell variable PPINSTALLDIR is set to the location of your {\Product} installation. Then in a command tool, type the following commands.

\begin{verbatim}
cd $PPINSTALLDIR/bin
pp_make_database -p daz daz
\end{verbatim}


\end{enumerate}

\section{Running the Confidence Tests}\label{INSTALLTEST}

The following procedure constitutes the installation confidence test for the {\daztool}.


\begin{enumerate}

\item
Initially, in the installation directory, create a test directory and copy in an example literate script by typing the following:

\begin{verbatim}
mkdir daztest
cd daztest
cp ../doc/wrk501.sml .
\end{verbatim}

\item
To get started, create a {\daztool} database and start up $xpp$ running a session of the {\daztool} on that database by typing the following into a command tool or $xterm$.

\begin{verbatim}
pp_make_database -p daz dazinst
xpp -command pp -d dazinst &
\end{verbatim}


\item
You should now have a {\daztool} session running in the journal area of {\tt xpp}, displaying a banner giving start-of-session information, licensing information and the release number, followed by the {\daztool} prompt: ``{\tt :)}''. (The session may take a minute or so to get started.)

Start up a command line tool in {\tt xpp}, from its {\tt Tools Menu}.

In the command line tool text area type:

\begin{verbatim}
use_file "wrk501";
\end{verbatim}
and hit the execute button.
This will make the tool process the literate script in the file $wrk501.sml$ which is the ``1000 Primes Example''.

The loading of the file should run to completion without error, which takes no longer than 5 minutes on a SPARCstation 1+.

Note that during processing of the script, the SPARK program will have been output to a file called $wrk501.ada$, and the Z document to a file called $wrk501.zdoc$.

\item
Using the $xpp$ File Menu, you may load the file $wrk501.ada$ and have a look at the generated SPARK program.

Similarly, you may load the file $wrk501.zdoc$ and have a look at the generated Z document.

\item
Now load the Z document you have just generated back into the {\daztool}. From the $xpp$ Execute Menu, restart the tool, and when the pop-up window asks for confirmation, hit the $OK$ button.

Next, bring up the command line tool, and type into it the following line:
\begin{verbatim}
use_file"wrk501.zdoc";
\end{verbatim}
and hit the execute button.

This will process the Z document in the file $wrk501.zdoc$ which we have just generated.

The loading of the file should run to completion without error.

\end{enumerate}

This completes the confidence tests and you may wish to delete the directory $daztest$ and its contents.
