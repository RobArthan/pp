\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

This document is a supplement to the guide entitled ``{\Product} Installation and Operation'' \cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR007}. The {\daztool} software is provided with your release of {\Product}. The installation of {\daztool} requires that you have already completed the installation of {\Product}.

To perform the installation and testing of {\daztool}, turn to chapter \ref{INSTALL}.

\section{Contents of This Document}

Chapter \ref{RELCONTENT} describes the contents of the release tape.

Chapter \ref{INSTALL} describes the installation of the {\daztool} software.

Section \ref{INSTALLTEST} describes the installation confidence test.

Chapter \ref{LIMITATIONS} describes the limitations of the {\daztool} software in the current release.


\chapter{RELEASE CONTENTS}
\label{RELCONTENT}

The {\daztool} software is overlaid on the directory structure of {\Product}. This section describes the files in the {\Product} directory structure that are specific to {\daztool}.

The tape which was used to load {\Product} already contains the {\daztool} software and documentation. There is no need to load in any further software from tape -- it is already present in your installation.

The following sections describe the files in the directory structure which are specific to the {\daztool}.

\section{Installation Directory}


The installation directory is the same as the installation directory used when installing {\Product}. This is set by the PPINSTALLDIR shell variable. There are no specific {\daztool} files in this directory. The {\daztool} software and documentation actually resides in subdirectories of \$PPINSTALLDIR.


\section{Binaries Directory}\label{BINDIR}

The directory $\$PPINSTALLDIR/\arch bin$ contains the {\daztool} database. When {\Product} is invoked with this database, the Compliance Tool facilities are available. 

\begin{table}[p]
\begin{center}

\def\LAB#1{\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}}#1\end{tabular}}

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{4in}|}\hline
Name & Description \\\hline\hline
\LAB{{\tt ./\arch bin/\arch pp_daz.db}}
	&
This files is the master \Product{} databases for the \ProductHOL\ and
\ProductZ. \\\hline
\LAB{{\tt ./\arch bin/sieveview}}
	&
This is a sieveview file which is customized for {\daztool}. It differs from the {\Product} or {\ProductZ} sieve steering file in that it has additional entries for dealing with Compliance Notation.
It replaces the file of the same name set up when {\Product} is installed.
 \\\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{center}
\caption{Contents of the Binaries Directory\label{BINDIRTAB}}
\end{table}

\section{Documentation Directory}\label{DAZDOCSDIR}
The directory {\tt ./docs} includes the design documentation of the {\daztool}. An example Compliance Notation script is also provided and constitutes the basis for confidence testing of your configuration.

\begin{table}[p]
\begin{center}

\def\LAB#1{\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}}#1\end{tabular}}

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{4in}|}\hline

	{\tt ./docs/wrk503.doc}\\
	{\tt ./docs/wrk503.dvi}\\
	{\tt ./docs/wrk503.sml}}
	&
These documents provide useful examples of Compliance Notation. $wrk501$ is the ``1000 Primes'' example, and $wrk503$ includes an example of a Specification in several modules.

These documents comprise the user documentation for the {\daztool}. $usr501$ is a guide for Using the Compliance Tool; $usr502$ is this installation guide.\\\hline

\subsection{Application Defaults Directory}\label{APPDDIR}
This is a directory used by Motif for defaults information,
and a sample defaults file for the Compliance Tool is provided.

\end{tabular}

\end{center}
\caption{Contents of the Application Defaults Directory\label{APPDDIRTAB}}
\end{table}

\subsection{Bitmaps Directory}\label{BITMAPSDIR}

The directory {\tt ./bitmaps} contains bitmaps which are used by the xpp tool to display the template selection box and any other bitmaps which \Product{} requires.
The bitmap files specific to the {\daztool} are described in table~\ref{BITMAPSDIRTAB}.

\begin{table}[p]
\begin{center}

\def\LAB#1{\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}}#1\end{tabular}}

	{\tt ./bitmaps/cnrefine.bmp}\\
	{\tt ./bitmaps/cnreplace.bmp}\\
	{\tt ./bitmaps/cnspecstat.bmp}}
	&
These are the bitmaps for displaying on the template buttons selected from the edit menu of xpp. \\\hline

\end{tabular}

\end{center}

\chapter{INSTALLATION}\label{INSTALL}

In the following steps, it is assumed that you are running X/Motif window manager and that your default shell is the $Bourne$ shell (or one of its derivatives).

\begin{enumerate}
\item
The only installation step required is to create a working {\daztool} database. Login as the user which you used to install {\Product} and check that the shell variable PPINSTALLDIR is set to the location of your {\Product} installation. Then in a command tool, type the following commands.

\begin{verbatim}
cd $PPINSTALLDIR/sun4bin
pp_make_database -p pp_daz daz
\end{verbatim}


\end{enumerate}

\section{Running the Confidence Tests}\label{INSTALLTEST}

The following procedure constitutes the installation confidence test for the {\daztool}.


\begin{enumerate}

\item
Initially, in the installation directory, create a test directory and copy in an example literate script by typing the following:

\begin{verbatim}
mkdir daztest
cd daztest
cp ../docs/wrk501.sml .
\end{verbatim}

\item
To get started, create a {\daztool} database and start up $xpp$ running a session of the {\daztool} on that database by typing the following into a command tool or $xterm$.

\begin{verbatim}
pp_make_database -p pp_daz dazinst
xpp -command pp -d dazinst &
\end{verbatim}


\item
You should now have a {\daztool} session running in the journal area of {\tt xpp}, displaying a banner giving start-of-session information, licensing information and the release number, followed by the {\daztool} prompt: ``{\tt :>}''. (The session may take a minute or so to get started.)

Start up a command line tool in {\tt xpp}, from its {\tt Tools} menu.

In the command line tool text area type:

\begin{verbatim}
use_file "wrk501";
\end{verbatim}
and hit the execute button.
This will process the literate script in the file $wrk501.sml$ which is the ``1000 Primes Example''.

The loading of the file should run to completion without error, which takes no longer than 5 minutes on a SPARCstation 1+.

Note that during processing of the script, the SPARK program will have been output to a file called $wrk501.ada$, and the Z document to a file called $wrk501.zdoc$.

\item
Using the $xpp$ File menu, you may load the file $wrk501.ada$ and have a look at the generated SPARK program.

Similarly, you may load the file $wrk501.zdoc$ and have a look at the generated Z document.

\item
Now load the Z document you have just generated back into the {\daztool}. From the $xpp$ Edit menu, restart the tool, and when the pop-up window asks for confirmation, hit the $OK$ button.

Next, bring up the command line tool, and type into it the following line:
\begin{verbatim}
use_file"wrk501.zdoc";
\end{verbatim}
and hit the execute button.

This will process the Z document in the file $wrk501.zdoc$ which we have just generated.

The loading of the file should run to completion without error.

\end{enumerate}

This completes the confidence tests and you may wish to delete the directory $daztest$ and its contents.


\chapter{KNOWN LIMITATIONS}\label{LIMITATIONS}

\chapter{CHANGES IN RELEASE \release}\label{CHANGES}

Changes between two superseded releases are best commented
out by ``=IGN'' and judicious use of spaces at starts of lines.
This will aid their recovery if a ``long'' leap is required for some customer.
