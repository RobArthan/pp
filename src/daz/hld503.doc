\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}

This document gives an overview of the part of the Compliance Notation Tool primarily concerned with extracting the Z and SPARK from a Compliance Notation script. It is written in response to \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/HLD501}, and provides a documentation link between that document and the detailed designs of the various modules required to meet the requirements for Compliance Notation Processing.


This document is intended to conform to all relevant local standards for designs identified in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/PLN003}.

\subsection{Introduction}

This document contains the high level design of the functions which support the processing of Compliance Notation to produce a Z document and a SPARK program. This design aims to meet the requirements for Compliance Notation Processing identified in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/HLD501}.

This document provides an amplification of the description of Compliance Notation Processing provided in section 3.2 of \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/HLD501} and the broad structure of that section is followed here.

\subsubsection{Background and Requirements}

See \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/HLD501}.

\subsection{Compliance}

Of particular importance to DRA is a demonstration of compliance between the technical specifications in the three volumes of {\DRASpecs} and the corresponding implementations. The compliance argument required comprises material in the detailed design and implementation of {{\DRASpecs}}.

The correspondance between DRA's specifications for the tool and the design and implementation documents which implement DRA's specifications is given in table \ref{DandIXRefs}.

\end{table}

The compliance argument is borne in mind during the development and implementation of the relevant parts of the tool. The following considerations affect the development of the tool.

\begin{description}

\item[Data Types:]{The data types required to support the abstract syntax of SPARK are defined in {\VolumeTwo} (for statements) and {\VolumeThree} (for basic declarations and expressions). All the abstract syntax data type definitions are gathered together in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD502}, and a mechanism for automatically generating the Standard ML structures from the Standard ML signatures is used. This technique means that the names of the data structures and the details of the data structures appear together in the same document and that the implementation of the data structures in the Standard ML structure remains in synchronisation. If this technique were not used, then it would make demonstration of the implementation with the specification provided in the detailed design more complex.}

\item[Isolation of the Implementation of {{\DRASpecs}}:]{In order to aid the compliance argument, effort is made to isolate those parts of the Compliance Tool design and implementation which correspond to {{\DRASpecs}} from other parts of the design and implementation which have not been formally specified by DRA.}

\item[Naming Conventions:]{Where a function has been specified in {{\DRASpecs}}, the design and implementation of the function in the tool corresponds in name to that used in {\DRASpecs} (subject to changes in case and use of the underscore character due to the need to follow already established conventions in {\Product}). Table \ref{NamingConventionsUsed} gives an example of each of the categories of change.}\footnote{
For type constructors, it is the convention in {\Product} to prefix the type constructor name with an acronym derived from the name of the datatype. Hence in table \ref{NamingConventionsUsed} $spark\_unary\_add$ acquires the prefix $UO$ derived from $UNARY\_OP$ in translation to the {\Product} type constructor name.}

\begin{table}
\center
\begin{tabular}{||l|l|l|l||}\hline
Z Construct & Example from {\DRASpecs} & {\Product} Equivalent & Example from {\Product} \\\hline\hline
Given Set & Z\_ID & type & Z\_ID \\ \hline
Schema Name & Agg\_Named & type & AGG\_NAMED \\ \hline
Schema Component & named\_assocs & record component & named\_assocs\\ \hline
Free Type Defn. & UNARY\_OP & datatype & UNARY\_OP \\ \hline
Free Type Branch & spark\_unary\_add & type constructor & UOSparkUnaryAdd \\ \hline
Schema as a function & Exp\_Bin\_Exp & function & exp\_bin\_exp \\ \hline
Axiomatic Defn. & trans\_decl & function & trans\_decl \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Naming Conventions Used}\label{NamingConventionsUsed}
\end{table}


\item[Visual Correspondance:]{An important means of demonstrating compliance is visual. A reader interested in checking the compliance with the Z specification is helped by the style of Standard ML programming adopted where the code can be traced with ease to its Z specification.}

\item[Explicit Argument:]{Where some deviation from the Z specification of {\DRASpecs} is necessary, the justification of the deviation and the argument of compliance of the implementation to the specification is provided in the relevant detailed design document under a section entitled Compliance.}

\end{description}

\section{DESIGN ISSUES}

When a web clause is presented to the tool a number of things happen. The web clause processor is invoked. This is a function which essentially drives the processing of a web clause; it calls the lexical analyser to tokenise the input and passes the tokens onto the compliance notation parser. This generates the abstract syntax. The web clause processor proceeds to call the Z document generator (corresponding to {\VolumeOne}) which updates the theory database with the abstract syntax of the web clause together with any Z declarations and generated verification conditions.

The process of outputting the Z to a file is not done by the web clause processor (similarly for the SPARK program); the user of the tool can invoke the outputting functions when appropriate.

The following subsections cover various aspects of this processing.

\subsection{Reader/Writer}\label{ReaderWriter}

Compliance notation comprises a sequence of web clauses interleaved with English text. Web clauses which constitute Z syntax (i.e., Z paragraphs) are covered in \cite[section 3.2]{DS/FMU/IED/USR001}.

Other web clauses are introduced by the preamble
=INLINEFT
 ¹CN
=TEX
\  and terminated with
=INLINEFT
 °
=TEX
.

These markers indicate to the reader/writer the start and end of a web clause.

For example, the following web clause:

¹CN
procedure primes is
§ all declarations ¢
begin
	„ p [true, primed p]
end primes;
°

was produced by typing the following.

=GFTSHOW
	¹CN
	procedure primes is
	§ all declarations ¢
	begin
		„ p [true, primed p]
	end primes;
	°
=TEX

The {\Product} reader/writer invokes the web clause processor when a web clause of the above form is recognised. The Compliance Notation reader/writer is an instance of a specific reader/writer and is geared to classifying the types of input required for processing compliance notation.

\subsubsection{Web Clause Processor}\label{WebClauseProcessor}

The web clause processor is the glue which is invoked by the Compliance Notation Reader/Writer on input of a web-clause. The processor invokes the lexical analyser, the parser and the Z generator function in that order. The design for the web clause processor is to be found in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD504}.

\subsubsection{Lexical Analyser}\label{LexicalAnalyser}
The lexical analyser has as its input an argument supplied by the
reader/writer.

The lexical analyser breaks its input up into a list of tokens,
ready for parsing, using a representation defined in
\cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD502}.

The lexical analyser comprises a single structure $CNLex$.

\subsubsection{Parser}\label{Parser}

The context free parser has as input the token list computed by the lexical
analyser. It parses the tokens according to the rules defined
in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD503} and produces as its result a tree
representation of the input term, using a datatype defined
in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD502}.
The parser is constructed using the parser generator, {\tt slrp},
described in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD013}.

The context free parser comprises a single structure $CNParser$.

\subsection{Z Generation}\label{ZGeneration}

The design of the ``Generation of the Z document'' specified in {\VolumeOne} is contained in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD507}. The corresponding implementation is provided in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/IMP507}.

Some of the informal checks described in section 17 of {\VolumeOne} are supported by the tool. Those which are supported are documented in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD505}. 

\subsubsection{Verification Conditions}\label{VerificationConditions}

The weakest precondition datatypes of {\VolumeTwo} are to be found in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD514}. The design and implementation of the verification condition generator is to be found in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD505} and \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/IMP505} respectively.

\subsubsection{Declarations and Expressions}\label{DeclarationsAndExpressions}

The abstract syntax for basic declarations and expressions of {\VolumeThree} are to be found in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD502}. The design and implementation of the basic declaration and expression generator is to be found in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD508} and \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/IMP508} respectively.

\subsection{SPARK Generation}

The SPARK program fragments are stored in abstract syntax during the processing of a literate script. When required, the fragments can be arranged and a formatting function can reproduce the SPARK program (see section \ref{SPARKOutputFunction}). The abstract syntax has been augmented to that specified in {\DRASpecs} where necessary to enable the SPARK program to be reproduced faithfully.

\subsection{Z and SPARK Output}

\subsubsection{SPARK Output Function}\label{SPARKOutputFunction}

The SPARK output function produces a file containing a SPARK program corresponding to the correct arrangement of SPARK fragments input to the compliance tool in the form of one or more literate scripts. Where k-slots have not been expanded, no code is generated and a comment denoting the label of the k-slot (if it has one) is generated in its place.
Where a specification statement has not been expanded, a ``NULL'' statement is introduced into the SPARK program, qualified by a comment indicating the label which expands the specification statement (if present).

\subsubsection{Z Output Function}\label{ZOutputFunction}

The Z output function produces a file containing the Z document as specified in {\DRASpecs}. The output function generates the document based on the theory database which during compliance notation processing accumulates Z definitions and verification conditions (stored as conjectures).

\subsection{Z Toolkit Extensions}\label{ZToolkitExtensions}

The Z toolkit extensions required are specified by DRA in {\VolumeOne}. These are implemented as a Z literate script which is processed by {\Product} (during system build) to produce a theory containing the specified extensions.

\subsection{Compliance Tool Functions}\label{ComplianceToolFunctions}

The functions which a user requires to operate the tool are packaged conveniently into a single structure called $ComplianceTool$.

\section{DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE}

The division of the Compliance Notation Processing into Standard ML structures is shown in the table \ref{SubsystemStructure}, which also indicates the detailed design document defining the structure and whether or not the structure is to be open.

Additional design documentation is required over and above that which directly responds to {\DRASpecs}, notably those modules related to the input and output of literate scripts, SPARK and Z where the design follows the philosophy adopted in the rest of {\Product}.

For each of the three volumes of {\DRASpecs} there is a corresponding design document which implements the functionality of the appropriate volume. However it is more convenient to gather the abstract syntax of the compliance notation together into a single document. Thus parts of Volumes 2 and 3 of {\DRASpecs} can be found in the abstract syntax detailed design \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD502}.

The data types of {{\VolumeOne}} concerned with representing information in environments, and those in {{\VolumeTwo}} concerned with weakest preconditions and ``Speclab''s are also placed in separate design documentation. This enables the types to be compiled during the development first. During development, changes to functions (which would otherwise have been specified in the same structure as type definitions) do not then necessitate the re-compilation of everything which depends on the types; this increases productivity during the development cycle significantly.

\end{table}

\section{DATA STORAGE AND FORMATS}\label{DataStorageAndFormats}

The organisation of data within {\Product} theory database during literate script processing is presented in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/HLD501} and is not reproduced here.

In order to support the running environment during processing of a literate script, Standard ML reference variables are used. These variables store the environment as specified in {\VolumeOne}. Details of the design and implementation of the environment are to be found in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD507} and \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/IMP507}.

The representation of abstract syntax of compliance notation is collected together in one detailed design document \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD502} which comprises the basic declaration and expression abstract syntax of {\VolumeThree}, the abstract syntax of statements in {\VolumeTwo}, and a non-formally specified representation of the structured aspects of SPARK such as packages, procedure specifications etc. The result is an single abstract syntax for representing entire web clauses.

The abstract syntax of Z specified in {\VolumeThree} is mapped onto the representation of Z already used in {\ProductZ} and is specified formally in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/ZED005}. The mapping of DRA's Z abstract syntax onto that used in {\Product} is dealt with in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD502}.

The representation of datatypes required for weakest preconditions {\VolumeTwo} is covered in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD514}. The design of the datatypes appears in this document and the implementation of this is generated automatically; the mechanism for this is provided as a Standard ML literate script in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/IMP514}.

The same approach has been taken for the design and implementation of environments for compliance notation specified in {\VolumeOne} which is covered in \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD513}.

\section{ERROR REPORTING AND RECOVERY}\label{ErrorReporting}

The presentation of error messages to the user is via the normal {\Product} error handling facilities; an message indicating that something was not expected is followed by the raising of a standard ML exception, e.g., $Fail$ or $Error$.

The Compliance Tool reports syntax errors by printing out the left context of the input encountered prior to the syntax error being detected.

When the tool encounters a web clause which cannot be handled formally (e.g., because the language feature is unsupported), the tool issues a warning message to this effect. If this situation is detected in a refinement step, then a dummy VC is generated indicating that this has happened. This feature helps to avoid the circumstance where the user might think that he/she has discharged all the proof obligations, when in fact an unsupported language feature might have inadvertantly been used and no VCs were generated for the relevant refinement step. 

Erroneous input leaves the tool in an unmodified state. This enables a user to develop the literate script interactively, correcting errors in the process. 

\section{TEST SPECIFICATION}
The integration tests for this subsystem are to comprise: a repeat of the module tests for the constituent modules in the context of a complete system; interactive tests are also required to check the behaviour of the reader/writer under various error conditions.

The integration tests are also to include inspection of the various displays and listings produced on the standard output by the subsystems.

The testing of the verification condition module requires appropriate environments to be constructed. It is recognised that creating a bona fide environment outside the context of the Z document generator is difficult and prone to error. For those parts of the verification condition testing where this proves to be difficult (e.g., procedure calls), module tests are not required, but integration testing needs to cover those cases omitted.

Testing the Z document generator is difficult without the other parts of the Compliance Tool being present. Therefore module tests for this are waived in preference to a detailed integration testing where the Z document generator can be tested in the context of other components of the system.

No module tests are planned for the implementation for structures which only introduce types. The testing of the presence of these types will be effectively done during the module tests of the functional components which use them, in addition to the integration tests.

The user interface structure \cite{ISS/HAT/DAZ/DTD515} requires no module tests and will be tested using integration tests - since the structure is merely red-tape wrapping for functions which are themselves tested either by module tests alone or by both module tests and integration tests together.
