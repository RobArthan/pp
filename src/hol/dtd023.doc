\section{GENERAL}

\subsection{Scope}
This document contains the signatures for the basic
definitions and axioms which form part of the ICL HOL
system. It is provided in response to the requirements
stated in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD011} and
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008}.

\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Background and Purpose}

The signatures for the basic definitions and axioms
each introduce the interfaces for the structures
of the same names. It is intended that the structures
will create the theories $min$, $log$, $init$ and $misc$,
using the interface to the abstract datatype $THM$,
see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD012}.

The basic definitions and axioms for ICL HOL have
been adapted from those of the ICL HOL prototype
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/SML008}.

\subsubsection{Interface}

This document defines the signatures $MinTheory$,
$LogTheory$ and $InitTheory$ and $MiscTheory$.
All four Standard ML structures corresponding to these
signatures will be open on entry.

\subsubsection{Deficiencies}

Strings are not indexed in ``=THDOC'' sections, but in
``=DESCRIBE'' sections.

\subsubsection{Dependencies}

The theory design section relies on the theory design tools
of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP035}, as well as a HOL parser.
The rest relies on, at least, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP012}.

\section{THEORY ``min''}
The theory ``min'' introduces the primitive
types and constants. 
\subsection{The Design of Theory ``min''}

The theory ``€min›'' introduces the primitive
types and constants.

=DESCRIBE
$€≠›$ is the HOL function type constructor.

req_type ("BOOL",0);
=DESCRIBE
$€BOOL›$ is the type of booleans, a type with exactly two values.

\subsection{The Signature $MinTheory$}

There are no interfaces to the structure 
in which ``min'' is implemented
and hence the signature is ``empty''.

The HOL type $BOOL$ is assigned to an ML variable of the same name in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD003}.

The signature $MinTheory$ contains the definitions for
the theory $min$. This introduces the primitive types and
constants of HOL.
