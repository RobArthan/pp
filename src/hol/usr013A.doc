\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

\section{What is ProofPower?}

ProofPower is a suite of tools providing support for the use of formal mathematical notations in the development of Information Systems.

The functionality supported is:

\begin{itemize}
\item
document preparation (see \TYPESETTING)
\item
syntax and type checking of specifications
\item
construction and checking of formal proofs
\item
theory management
\end{itemize}

These are described in greater detail below.

\section{Attributes of ProofPower}

{\Product} has been designed and implemented with the following attributes in mind:

\begin{itemize}
\item Pedigree
\item Power
\item Assurance
\item Openness
\item Extensibility
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pedigree}

{\Product} is in the tradition of {\it Principia Mathematica} \cite{whitehead10}.
It is based on Church's Simple Theory of Types \cite{church40}, augmented by Milner style polymorphism \cite{milner78}.
Its implementation builds on research at Universities of Edinburgh \cite{gordon79}, Cambridge \cite{gordon87,gordon93} and Oxford \cite{spivey92}.
It follows the {\lcfparadigm} \cite{gordon87}, using standard ML as a `meta-language' \cite{harper88}.

\subsubsection{Logic}

Following {\it Principia Mathematica}, {\Product} supports as its primary object language (in which specifications are written and proofs conducted) a logical type theory with a small number of primitive constructs.
In the context of this logical system the main body of classical mathematics may be developed without further logical extensions other than conservative extensions which serve to define the concepts used to express the mathematics.
The main merit of this approach is that once the primitive logical system has been de-bugged (i.e., shown to be consistent) the further development of mathematical theories can be undertaken without risk of compromising the consistency of the logic.

The logical system used in {\it Principia Mathematica} was Russell's {\it Theory of Types} \cite{russell08}, the first of many logical type theories to be developed.  Probably the simplest type theory adequate for classical mathematics is the {\it Simple Theory of Types} published by Alonzo Church in 1940.
Church's formulation formed the basis for the logical system implemented in the proof tool for Higher Order Logic ({\hol}) developed by Mike Gordon and others at the University of Cambridge \cite{gordon93}.
This same formulation of {\hol} was adopted without material changes for use in {\Product}.

The transition from the simple Theory of Types to the logical system of Cambridge {\hol}, apart from some minor adjustments to the primitive constants and axioms, consists in adding those features which are desirable for the practical usability of the logic for the development of mathematics or for applications in Computer Science and Information Systems Engineering.
The most significant of these are the introduction of {\it type variables} into the object language, giving an essential element of polymorphism, and the prescription of acceptable means of conservative extension, enabling new terminology to be safely introduced.

The polymorphism adopted is due to Robin Milner \cite{milner78}, and was originally used in the LCF system developed at the University of Edinburgh \cite{gordon79}.

\subsubsection{Implementation}

The implementation method adopted in the LCF system (which we often refer to as the {\lcfparadigm}) was also used in {\Product} and is the source of many of the product characteristics.  This involves the use of a strongly typed functional programming language as a meta-language both for the implementation of the proof tool and as the language in which the user interacts with the system.  The meta-language used in {\Product} is `standard ML' a more modern development than the ML available at the time the Cambridge {\hol} system was implemented.

\subsection{Power}

{\Product} supports expressive and convenient notations in strong logical systems providing a productive environment for specification and proof development.

{\Product-HOL} is:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Logically as expressive as Zermelo set theory.
\item
Logically extendible in safe and well understood ways.
\item
Notationally concise.
\item
A very simple language.
\end{itemize}

{\Product-HOL} has a very high power to weight ratio, giving high levels of expressiveness and logical strength for very low levels of complexity.

{\Product} also supports the specification language Z, which provides more concise notations at the cost of some increase in complexity.

The functional programming language `standard ML' is used as a meta-language in {\Product}, for user interaction, as the language for describing proofs, and as a productive vehicle for programming proof automation and for extending and adapting the capabilities of {\Product} to particular application domains.

These notations combine to give high levels of productivity in specification and proof, which are continually improved as the system is developed.

\subsection{Assurance}

{\Product} provides unparallelled levels of assurance in the correctness of propositions proven using {\Product} about specifications written in {\Product-HOL} or {\Product-Z}.

This assurance derives from:

\begin{itemize}
\item
The simple uncontroversial classical logical system.

Which reduces to a minimum the risk that the logic is inconsistent or unsound or its implementation flawed.

\item
The availability of mathematical and formal specifications of the syntax and semantics of the formal system.

Which further increases confidence in the soundness of the logic and the correctness of its implementation.

\item
The provision of good support for specification by conservative extension.

Which ensures that any errors arising while writing specifications do not compromise the consistency of the logical framework within which reasoning about these specification is conducted.

\item
The small logical kernel ($<$10\% of the code in the system), implemented as an abstract datatype, which enforces the logical soundness of proofs.

Minimisation of code in the system critical to the checking of proofs provides maximal confidence in correctness of the checking and enables further development of high level proof capabilities to be done without any risk of compromising the checking of proofs.

\item
The formal specification of the logical kernel.

Which ensures not only that the logic itself is well understood but also that the mechanisms which enforce the checking of proofs against that logic have been thoroughly scrutinised.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Openness}

{\Product} is `open' in several different senses of that term:

\begin{itemize}
\item
{\Product} provides support for standard well documented languages  (Standard ML, {\hol}, Z, SAL/SPARK).
Where standards are in place or under development {\Product} is intended to implement or intercept these standards.

\item
Most of the functions used to implement {\Product} are available for re-use by the user if he wishes to extend or customise the system.

\item
A comprehensive reference manual (600 + pages) is supplied documenting the functions supported by {\Product} ($>$1000 ML names).

\item
Extensive libraries of theories and `proof contexts' are provided for re-use.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Extensibility}

The open architecture of the {\lcfparadigm} maximises the extent to which users can extend and customise the system to meet their special requirements.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Users have access to the meta-language (Standard ML) for:

\begin{itemize}
\item
developing proofs
\item
extending the system
\item
implementing domain specific (or general purpose) proof automation
\end{itemize}

\item
The definitional forms acceptable to the system are extendible.

Specifications are acceptable in any form provided that they can be shown to be consistent.
Automatic consistency provers invoked by the system can be replaced or supplemented by the user extending the forms of specification which are accepted by the system as consistent.

\item
Many aspects of the behaviour of the automatic proof capabilities are context sensitive, enabling their effects to be continually augmented with knowledge of new problem domains.
Customisable `proof contexts' provide this information to the proof system and enable the proof developer to select a suitable context for conducting any particular proof, maximising the extent to which the proof support system eliminates or simplifies goals or subgoals automatically.

\item
The system is designed to support multiple object languages and permits mixed language working.

\item
Parser generators are available to simplify the task of providing support for additional notations.

\end{itemize}

\section{Languages Supported}

{\Product} is designed to support multiple object languages in a single coherent semantic framework.
The approach of implementing secondary object languages by semantic embedding into the primary object language {\ProductHOL} not only provides for multiple notations, but enables specifications in distinct notations to be related to each other formally, and permits results to be transferred from one language to another.

The following languages are currently supported:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Standard ML (as meta-language)
\item
Higher Order Logic
\item
Z
\end{itemize}

Support for SAL, the SPARK Annotation Language, has been prototyped, but is not yet generally available.

We hope to be able to provide support for ISO Standard Z when the standard has stabilised.

\section{Functionality}

{\Product} is a suite of programs and scripts intended to assist in the development and checking of formal specifications and proofs.

The functionality supported is:

\begin{itemize}
\item
document preparation/printing (see \TYPESETTING):

\begin{itemize}
\item
using {\LaTeX} `literate scripts' with extended fonts for document sources
\item
indexes, cross reference and theory listings
\end{itemize}

\item
syntax check/type check (interactive or batch)

\item
formal reasoning (interactive or batch)

\item
theory management:

\begin{itemize}
\item
specifications and theorems held in theory hierarchy
\item
programmable access to theory hierarchy
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Document Preparation}

{\Product} provides facilities for producing documents containing specifications and proof scripts exploiting the {\LaTeX} typesetting software.
Following Knuth \cite{knuth84a}, these are known as `literate scripts'.

The facilities include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Screen fonts for use with Sunview or X which enable source documents including formal specification material to be written using the appropriate special characters rather than ASCII encodings.
\item
Under X, a custom-built editor for developing scripts using the special characters.
\item
Tools for preprocessing source documents prior to their being processed by the {\Product} proof tool or {\LaTeX}.
\item
Output from {\Product} suitable for inclusion in {\LaTeX} documents.
\item
The production of indexes of defining occurrences of formal names in {\LaTeX} documents.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Syntax and Type Checking}

{\Product} processes a variety of formal notations including standard ML, Higher Order Logic, and Z.
These are typically mixed together in a mixed language dialogue with the system.
The system operates either interactively with a user at a console, usually making heavily use of cut and paste between {\Product} and external text editors, or in a batch mode of operation where input is read from a nominated file and output written to the standard output and/or other files.

Each of the notations used in interacting with {\Product} is {\it strongly typed}.
This makes it possible to provide valuable diagnostic information at the time of processing of each definition or specification.

\subsection{Proof Development}

Following the {\lcfparadigm} proofs are created and checked in {\Product} as computations which result in values of type {\it THM}.
{\it THM} is an abstract type in the meta-language standard ML, and as such the means of computing values of this type are strictly limited to those provided at the time the type was defined.
The constructors of the type {\it THM} have been engineered to correspond to inference rules in the supported logic, HOL, so that any value of type THM computed must follow by the rules of the logic from the declared axioms.
Proof automation is provided by the implementation of high level proof development facilities which ultimately compute theorems only through the inference mechanisms built into the definition of the data type THM.

Though proofs are always ultimately comprised of elementary proof steps, the availability of a powerful modern functional programming language for generating such proofs permits continually growing sophistication in the automatic proof facilities provided.
New subject domains can be incorporated in the scope of these automatic facilities, and users can customise and extend these capabilities to meet the special requirements arising in their applications.

\subsection{Theory Management}

In order that the system is able to give reliable indications of what theorems are derived from what premises, or in the context of which specifications, the system must manage in a secure way the axioms, definitions and theorems which are used in the development of specifications and proofs.
These are organised in a theory hierarchy, permitting reusable theories to be exploited in different applications.  An initial theory hierarchy is supplied with the system containing some commonly used theories, such as natural numbers, and lists.

\section{Levels of Use of ProofPower}

{\Product} may be used by several different types of user for different purposes.  These different groups may require distinct levels of knowledge of {\Product} for their particular purposes.

\subsection{Education}

{\Product} has potential as an educational tool, even in areas not directly related to {\Product} or to the languages supported by {\Product}.  For example, after development of suitable course material {\Product} might be used to support courses in logic and set theory.  Course material of this nature is not yet available with the {\Product} system, but we hope that eventually it will be.

If training material was developed for teaching such topics using {\Product}, the level of knowledge of {\Product} required for using the material could be made very small.

For those learning the specification languages {\hol} or Z, the proof facilities provided by {\Product} are beneficial in developing an understanding of the semantics of these notations.

\subsection{Specification}

{\Product} is a useful and effective tool for those who wish to develop formal specifications of information systems, even if they have no requirement for conducting proofs about these specifications.  Such users could use the document preparation facilities for writing their specifications, having these syntax and type checked interactively and incrementally by {\Product} as the specification is developed.

Those wishing to use {\Product} for developing and checking specifications in this way need have little more than an understanding of the specification language which they propose to use.

\subsection{Proof Development}

The group of users on whom {\Product} is most deliberately targetted are those who wish to develop formal specifications and then reason about or in the context of these specifications.

\subsection{Research and Development}

Because of its openness and extensibility {\Product} provides a good vehicle for many kinds of research, concerning the theory and practice of Formal Methods, or aspects of AI such as automated deduction.

It is also suitable as a platform for the development of tools with capabilities which include formal reasoning, or for interactive course support material for academic courses involving formal specification or discrete mathematics.
Cutomised window based interfaces can be implemented using the Motif interfaces built into {\Product}.

It is this kind of use of {\Product} which is likely to require the most detailed and comprehensive knowledge of the facilities provided by {\Product}.

\section{Using ProofPower}
The usual way of using {\Product} to develop specifications and proofs
involves two parallel interactive tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Using an editor to develop a literate script in which specifications and proofs are recorded.
\item
Executing {\ProductML} commands, typically extracted from the script.
This is the means by which specifications are checked and by which proof steps are taken.
\end{itemize}

Under the X Windows system, an integrated program {\tt xpp} is supplied to support both of these tasks.
For an introduction to the basic use of {\Product} the reader is referred to chapter 1 of \TUTORIAL.

\section{Introduction to Proof}

The proofs of many results are either automatic or straightforward using {\Product}.

\subsection{Areas of Automation}

The following are examples of areas where proof automation in {\Product} is particularly effective:

\begin{itemize}
\item
propositional tautologies

{ ProofPower proves these automatically, and uses propositional reasoning to simplify non-propositional goals automatically.}

\item
first order predicate calculus

{ Often these will also be automatically provable using a form of resolution.
Where resolution fails, there is a simple systematic approach to proving these results using ProofPower.}

\item
elementary set theory

{ A useful collection of results from elementary set theory are automatically provable.}

\item
other classes of results

{ Whenever a new theory is introduced one or more proof contexts may be developed to solve automatically a range of results in that theory.
`Decision procedures' for such classes of results can be made available via `prove\_tac'.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A Simple Predicate Calculus Proof}

The following example illustrated the style of a simple proof in {\Product}.

Most proofs are conducted using the subgoaling package (see Chapter \ref{GoalOrientedProof}).
The following example shows how proofs of results in the first order predicate calculus can be conducted systematically using only two {\it TACTIC}s.

To conduct such a proof the first thing to do is set the goal to be proven:

\ignore{
=SML
open_theory "hol";
new_theory "usr013";
set_pc "hol2";
=TEX
}
=SML
set_goal([],¬(µx y· P x ´ R y) ¤ (µv w· ³ P w ² R v)®);
=TEX

The `two tactic method' uses proof by contradiction, which is initiated using {\it contr_tac}.
Such a proof is reduced to derivation of ¬F® from the negation of the required result (the conclusion of the original goal).
The negated assumption is pre-processed automatically by {\it contr_tac} and this results in two subgoals, the first of which is shown below.

=SML
a contr_tac;
=TEX
=GFT ProofPower output
Tactic produced 2 subgoals:
...
(* *** Goal "1" *** *)

(*  3 *)  ¬µ x y· P x ´ R y®
(*  2 *)  ¬P w®
(*  1 *)  ¬³ R v®

(* ?ô *)  ¬F®
=TEX

The proof now proceeds by specialising the universals in the assumptions until the system is able to derive the required contradiction.
In this case specialisation of assumption 3 with the values ¬w® and ¬v® will enable the contradiction to be derived:

=SML
a (list_spec_asm_tac ¬µ x y· P x ´ R y® [¬w®,¬v®]);
=TEX

=GFT ProofPower output
Tactic produced 0 subgoals:
=TEX

The first subgoal is discharged automatically once the necessary specialisation has been identified, and the subgoal package then present the second subgoal:

=GFT ProofPower output
(* *** Goal "2" *** *)

(*  3 *)  ¬µ v w· ³ P w ² R v®
(*  2 *)  ¬P x®
(*  1 *)  ¬³ R y®

(* ?ô *)  ¬F®
=TEX
Specialisation of assumption 3 is again the way forward, in this case to the values ¬y® and ¬x®:
=SML
a (list_spec_asm_tac ¬µ v w· ³ P w ² R v® [¬y®,¬x®]);
=GFT ProofPower output
Tactic produced 0 subgoals:
Current and main goal achieved
=TEX
This enables discharge of the second subgoal and completes the proof.
The theorem can then be obtained as an ML value:
=SML
pop_thm();
=GFT ProofPower output
Now 0 goals on the main goal stack
val it = ô (µ x y· P x ´ R y) ¤ (µ v w· ³ P w ² R v) : THM
=TEX
The reader should be able to conduct proofs of many elementary results in {\Product} using these facilities and a collection of exercises which should now be achievable are given in section \ref{EasyProofs}.


\section{Notational Conventions}

Formal text is included throughout this tutorial, mainly giving examples of input and output from {\Product}.

Formal material is almost always distinguished from informal text by the presence of either an enclosing box or a vertical bar on the left, usually with some kind of indicator at the top of what kind of formal material it is.

The most frequent formal inserts are in Standard ML and these are marked by a vertical bar headed by the acronym SML.
These inserts represent samples of input to {\Product}, and are often followed by the resulting output from {\Product}.

For example, if the following is entered into a {\Product} session:

=SML
3+4+5;
=TEX
the following output results:
=GFT ProofPower output
val it = 12 : int
=TEX

Within Standard ML in {\Product} it is possible to include quotations in other languages, of which the most important in this tutorial is {\hol}.
This is done by enclosing the quotation in `Quine corners'.

When quoted in this way an expression in Higher Order Logic evaluates to a value in Standard ML of type {\term}:
=SML
¬3+4+5®;
=TEX
and when a value of type {\term} is displayed the {\hol} pretty-printer is normally invoked automatically:
=GFT ProofPower output
val it = ¬3 + 4 + 5® : TERM
=TEX
Normally in text of the tutorial, where it is necessary to quote an expression in {\hol}, these same quotation marks will be used.

Many of the concepts which it is necessary to discuss in explaining Higher Order Logic as implemented in {\Product} correspond to a type or a value in standard ML as used in the implementation of {\Product}.
Terms and types in Higher Order Logic are represented in standard ML using values whose ML types are {\term} and {\type} respectively.

In interests of precision in the informal text, wherever an informal concept correponds precisely to a formally defined concept, the name of the formally defined concept may be used in the informal text as well as in formal texts.
For example, {\hol} types are represented in ML by values of ML type {\type} and therefore whenever they are referred to in the informal text they are referred to by the name `{\type}'.
In some places other kinds of type are referred to, e.g. ML types, and in these places the notation `{\type}' is not used.

For each technical term a `defining occurrence' is displayed in bold type, and its page number appears in the index at the end of the document.
Other occurrences appear in italics when it is intended to emphasise that the term has been defined elsewhere.
It is intended that the appearance of a word or phrase in italics should indicate that this word or phrase has been defined elsewhere, and the location of this description may be found in the index.

\section{Using the ProofPower Reference Manual}

This tutorial is intended to provide a coverage similar to that of the short {\Product-HOL} course, and is not an exhaustive account of {\Product}.
Many of the facilities are mentioned with very brief or no description.

To become a proficient user of {\Product} it is necessary to become familiar with use of the {\REFERENCE}.
All of the ML names mentioned in this tutorial are documented in the \REFERENCE, and the documentation may be found by reference to the one of the indexes to be found in that manual.

The ÛKWICÝ index in the {\REFERENCE} is also invaluable in identifying the full range of facilities available.
Each ML name is composed of a number of atoms separated by underscore symbols, and the {\kwic} index groups together all the names containing any particular atom irrespective of where in the name the atom appears.

Knowledge of a small number of naming conventions enables the user to identify all the relevant facilities of a particular kind.
For example, all tactics have names ending in the atom `tac', and may therefore be found grouped together in the {\kwic} index under `tac'.
All the rewriting facilities have the atom `rewrite' in their name, and will be found grouped together in the {\kwic} index.

Once the reader has grasped the main principles of {\Product} and {\Product-HOL}, it is a good idea to have a browse through the {\kwic} index to get an idea of the range of facilities available.
Then when he is confronted with a problem in a proof he will know whether there is something already available which may help to solve the problem, and can then look up the documentation in detail to discover how the relevant facilities are used.
