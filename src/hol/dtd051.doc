\subsection{Changes Forecast}
This document needs to know which functions it may
give context for, and the type of the proof context details.
Thus if a new tool using context is added to the system then this document will need
modification.

In particular, the expected resolution tool will be parameterised in some manner yet to be decided,
and when introduced will require changes to this document
and its implementation.
\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
provision of proof contexts.
This is called for in section \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD???}.
The design is implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP051}.

\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
A proof context is a setting of various
parameters of proof tools to support a particular mode of proof.
For instance, both $rewrite\_tac$ and $strip\_tac$ 
are proof tools that may be parameterised.
In particular, proof contexts will be later made available,
through the tools supplied here,
that supply a good environment to reason about Z,
or within a particular theory (e.g. set theory),
and alter the default environment.

An alternative approach to the one chosen is to take a 
proof context to be a labeled list of functions of type $:unit\ ->\ unit$.
A proof context would then be ``set'' by applying each function in the proof context to $()$.
This has the advantage that new context-sensitive tools could be
introduced without a system rebuild.
However, one loses the ability to display even parts
of the context, or access to the data to which
an individual function could be set.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This document is dependent on \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP008}.
It also depends on knowledge of what context-sensitive tools it
needs to cover.
It further depends on being able to create at least dummy
values for the parameters of these functions.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
We fail to give the developer of a context-sensitive proof tool the means to add an ``understanding'' of the new tool without
modifying this document and its implemetation.
They will have to modify this document and its implementation and then rebuild the system
(an approach only available to someone supplied with the means to do a system build), or provide their own proof context
tools, perhaps ``piggy backing'' upon the ones supplied here.

\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
Proof contexts are often associated with theories,
so it might be nice if the theory lister tells you the names
of those contexts associated with the theory listed.
\subsubsection{Terminology}
An {\em equational context} is a list of conversions,
each paired with term index. It represents a context that states
how to
rewrite a term to result in an equational theorem,
guided by the outermost form of the term to be rewritten.
An equational context will be of type $EQN\_CXT$
(== $(TERM\ *\ CONV)list$).

A {\em proof context} holds the data used to provide context for selected proof tools
(currently rewriting and stripping).
It may either be in a user-interface form, with type $PROOF\_CONTEXT$,
or in an evaluated form, with type $EPROOF\_CONTEXT$.

\section{THE DESIGN}
=DOC
signature ‚ProofContext· = sig
=DESCRIBE
This provides the basic tools for handling proof contexts.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Equational Contexts}
=DOC
type ‚EQN_CXT·;
=DESCRIBE
This is the type of equational contexts.
An equational context is a list of conversions,
each paired with term index. It represents a statement of
how to
rewrite a term to result in an equational theorem,
guided by the outermost form of the term to be rewritten,
which is matched against the term index of each conversion.
It is used to create a single conversion via $eqn\_cxt\_conv$ (q.v.).

A theorem may be converted into a member of 
an equational context by $thm\_eqn\_cxt$.
A pre-existing conversion may be converted by determining
the term index that matches at least all terms that 
the conversion must work on
(see $net\_enter$ for details), and pair it with the conversion.
Û
type EQN_CXT = (TERM * CONV) list;
Ê
Note that equational contexts can be merged by appending.
An equational context may be transformed into a conversion 
discrimination net by $make\_net$ or $list\_net\_enter$(q.v.).
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val ‚thm_eqn_cxt· : THM -> (TERM * CONV);
=DESCRIBE
A theorem may be transformated into a suitable member of 
an equational context ($EQN\_CXT$ q.v.)
by $thm\_eqn\_cxt$:
Û
thm_eqn_cxt `ˆ Ö É x1 ... é LHS = RHS` ã
	(LHS, simple_eq_match_1_conv `ˆ Ö É x1 ... é LHS = RHS`)
Ê
where the universal quantifiers must be simple.
=SEEALSO
$cthm\_eqn\_cxt$ which canonicalises
a theorem before transformation.
=FAILURE
7095	?0 is not of the form `ˆ Ö É x1 ... xn é u = v' where ªxiº are variables
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val ‚eqn_cxt_conv· : EQN_CXT -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This function creates a single conversion from an equational
context.
This is done via $make\_net$ and $net\_lookup$(q.v).
There is an implicit $CHANGED\_C$ wrapped around each
conversion in the equational context.
=FAILURE
51005	Equational context gave no conversions that succeeded for ?0
=ENDDOC

\subsection{Proof Contexts}
The goal of the following functions is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
To give a naive user a simple command to change
the proof context.
This will change the individual context of all context-sensitive proof tools,
to provide the best context available for the style of work they are to then carry out.
\item
To give the developer of, say, a new theory the means
to create a proof context suitable for reasoning in that theory.
\item
To allow a piece of proof automation to change the proof context,
do some work, and then revert to the previous context.
\item
To provide a single place where all context-sensitive tools look
for their contexts.
\end{enumerate}
We then first have the user presentation of a proof context:
=DOC
type ‚PROOF_CONTEXT·;
=DESCRIBE
This is the type of a proof context, which holds the data used to provide context for selected proof tools
(currently rewriting and stripping).
A proof context is set by first evaluating something of
this type, using $evaluate\_proof\_context$ (q.v.),
and then setting the result using $push\_proof\_context$ (q.v.)
This is an abstract data type, with interface functions:
Û
set_pc_name			get_pc_name
set_pc_rw_eqn_cxt		get_pc_rw_eqn_cxt
set_pc_rw_canons		get_pc_rw_canons
set_pc_st_eqn_cxt		get_pc_st_eqn_cxt
set_pc_sg_eqn_cxt		get_pc_sg_eqn_cxt
set_pc_cs_Ñ_rule			get_pc_cs_Ñ_rule
Ê
(see descriptions of individual functions for details)

In naming the interface functions (other than $set\_pc\_name$) we use the convention:
Û
<set|get>_pc_<proof tool>_<modifier>
Ê
The proof tools in the above are: $rw$ for rewriting,
$st$ for stripping theorems, $sg$ for stripping goals,
and $cs$ for constant specifications.
$initial\_pc$(q.v.) is a ``no effect'' proof context.
=ENDDOC

It is intended that a designer of, say, a theory would 
work out a few (often only one) proof contexts
for working with the theory.
They would bind these to ML variables, and would
likewise bind the evaluated forms (see below).
If a user then wanted, say, the standard rewriting equational context
for that theory they would extract it from the ML variable bound to the appropriate unevaluated proof context,
rather than expecting to find it
separately stored.
We wish to be able to set such a proof context
with no more evaluation cost than a few assignments.
This implies that we must to do any pre-evaluation
at the point of creation of a context, rather than the setting of the context.
This evaluated proof context is of type:
=DOC
type ‚EPROOF_CONTEXT·;
=DESCRIBE
This is the type of an evaluated proof context, which holds the data used to provide individual contexts for certain proof tools,
in a form where setting context only requires an assignment to a variable.
Objects of this type are created by $evaluate\_proof\_context$ (q.v.),
or ``by hand'',
and may be set by $push\_proof\_context$
(q.v.).
This is an abstract data type, with interface functions:
Û
set_epc_name			get_epc_name
set_epc_rw_net		get_epc_rw_net
set_epc_rw_canon		get_epc_rw_canon
set_epc_st_conv		get_epc_st_conv
set_epc_sg_conv		get_epc_sg_conv
set_epc_cs_Ñ_rule		get_epc_cs_Ñ_rule
Ê
(see descriptions of individual functions for details)

In naming the interface functions (other than $set\_epc\_name$)
we use the convention:
Û
<set|get>_epc_<proof tool>_<modifier>
Ê
The proof tools in the above are: $rw$ for rewriting,
$st$ for stripping theorems, $sg$ for stripping goals,
and $cs$ for constant specifications.
$initial\_epc$(q.v.) is a ``no effect'' evaluated proof context
(not the same as the evaluation of $initial\_pc$ however).

equal to $initial\_epc$, as the later does no

val ‚merge_proof_context· : PROOF_CONTEXT -> 
	PROOF_CONTEXT -> PROOF_CONTEXT;
=DESCRIBE 
This function merges two unevaluated proof contexts
to gain a third, that is the sum of their effects.
The merging is simplistic (e.g. if merging list components then the second list is appended to the end of the first), and therefore the merged context
may be inefficient compared to a ``hand-crafted'' one,
and there may be interference between the components of
the two contexts (e.g. hiding of effects or introduction
of the possibility of looping).
The name of the result will be
Û
<name1> ^ " and " ^ <name2>
Ê
=SEEALSO
$PROOF\_CONTEXT$
=ENDDOC

Pre-evaluation will be done by combining functions supplied
by individual tools into the single function.
This implies that all context-sensitive proof tools will be
supplied with pre-evaluation functions
(perhaps of more general use than for the individual function);
and will get their individual context by accessing the current proof context
via $get\_proof\_context$.

Thus the function, $evaluate\_proof\_context$ cannot be defined until after all the context-sensitive tools are implemented.
=IGN

val ‚evaluate_proof_context· : PROOF_CONTEXT -> EPROOF_CONTEXT;
 =DESCRIBE
This function does all possible pre-evaluation
of the material stored in an object of type $PROOF\_CONTEXT$,
leaving the result in a form where setting the context only requires assignment to variables.
Such a context is then set by $push\_proof\_context$
(q.v.).
