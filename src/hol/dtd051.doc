\subsection{Changes Forecast}
The designer of this document needs to know which functions it may
give context for, and the type of the proof context details.
Thus if a new tool using context is added to the system then this document will need
modification.

In particular, the expected resolution tool will be parameterised in some manner yet to be decided,
and when introduced will require changes to this document
and its implementation.
\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
provision of proof contexts.
This is called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD???}.
The design is implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP051}.

\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
A proof context is a setting of various
parameters of proof tools to support a particular mode of proof.
For instance, both $rewrite\_tac$ and $strip\_tac$ 
are proof tools that may be parameterised.
In particular, proof contexts will be later made available,
through the tools supplied here,
that supply a helpful environment to reason about Z,
or within a particular theory (e.g. set theory),
and alter the default environment.

An alternative approach to the one chosen is to take a 
proof context to be a labeled list of functions of type $:unit\ ->\ unit$.
A proof context would then be ``set'' by applying each function in the proof context to $()$.
This has the advantage that new context-sensitive tools could be
introduced without a system rebuild.
However, one loses the ability to display even parts
of the context, or access to the data to which
an individual function could be set.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This document is dependent on \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP008}.
It also depends on knowledge of what context-sensitive tools it
needs to cover.
It further depends on being able to create at least dummy
values for the parameters of these functions.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
We fail to give the developer of a context-sensitive proof tool the ability to add an ``understanding'' of the new tool without
modifying this document and its implementation.
They will have to modify this document and its implementation and then rebuild the system
(an approach only available to someone supplied with the ability to do a system build), or provide their own proof context
tools, perhaps ``piggy backing'' upon the ones supplied here.

\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
Proof contexts are often associated with theories,
so it might be nice if the theory lister tells you the names
of those contexts associated with the theory listed.
\subsubsection{Terminology}
An {\em equational context} is a list of conversions,
each paired with term index. It represents a context that states
how to
rewrite a term to result in an equational theorem,
guided by the outermost form of the term to be rewritten.
An equational context will be of type $EQN\_CXT$
(== $(TERM\ *\ CONV)list$).

A {\em proof context} holds the data used to provide context for selected proof tools.

\section{THE DESIGN}

signature €ProofContext› = sig

This provides the basic tools for handling equational and proof contexts.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Equational Contexts}
=DOC
type €EQN_CXT›;
=DESCRIBE
This is the type of equational contexts.
An equational context is a list of conversions,
each paired with term index. It represents a statement of
how to
rewrite a term to result in an equational theorem,
guided by the outermost form of the term to be rewritten,
which is matched against the term index of each conversion.
It is used to create a single conversion via $eqn\_cxt\_conv$ (q.v.).

A theorem may be converted into a member of 
an equational context by $thm\_eqn\_cxt$.
A pre-existing conversion may be converted by determining
the term index that matches at least all terms that 
the conversion must work on
(see $net\_enter$ for details), and pair it with the conversion.
=GFT
type EQN_CXT = (TERM * CONV) list;
=TEX
Note that equational contexts can be merged by appending.
An equational context may be transformed into a conversion 
discrimination net by $make\_net$ or $list\_net\_enter$(q.v.).
=ENDDOC

val €thm_eqn_cxt› : THM -> (TERM * CONV);

A theorem may be transformed into a suitable member of 
an equational context ($EQN\_CXT$ q.v.)
by $thm\_eqn\_cxt$:
=GFT
thm_eqn_cxt `á Ù µ x1 ... ∑ LHS = RHS` ≠
	(LHS, simple_eq_match_1_conv `á Ù µ x1 ... ∑ LHS = RHS`)

where the universal quantifiers must be simple.

a theorem before transformation.

val €eqn_cxt_conv› : EQN_CXT -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This function creates a single conversion from an equational
context.
This is done via $make\_net$ and $net\_lookup$(q.v).
There is an implicit $CHANGED\_C$ wrapped around each
conversion in the equational context.

\subsection{Proof Contexts}
The goal of the following functions is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
To give a naive user a simple command to change
the proof context.
This will change the individual context of all context-sensitive proof tools,
to provide the best context available for the style of work they are to then carry out.
\item
To give a more experienced user the ability to merge
together the effect of a number of proof contexts into the current proof context.
\item
To give the developer of, say, a new theory the means
to create a proof context suitable for reasoning in that theory.
\item
To allow a piece of proof automation to change the proof context,
do some work, and then revert to the previous context.
\item
To provide a single place where all context-sensitive tools look
for their contexts.
\end{enumerate}
We implement proof contexts by maintaining two data structures:
a database of proof contexts, in which a proof context is a record
in the database, and a particular part of the proof context is
a field of the proof context;
and a stack of proof contexts, which has the current proof context as the top record.
Proof contexts are pushed onto the stack from the database,
they have no existence apart from within these two structures.

A proof context has a number of fields, each field relating
to some single area of context for a context-sensitive
proof tool.
A proof context is created by $new\-\_pc$.
Its fields are populated by data that comes from other
proof contexts in the database (by $merge\-\_pc$ and
$merge\-\_pc\-\_fields$), and that is entered by
the proof contexts creator.
A proof context in is in the middle of its creation may still be
pushed onto the proof context stack, but it may not be used
as the origin of data for a field of another proof context.
When a proof context is considered complete it is ``committed''
by $commit\-\_pc$, and it then becomes an
acceptable origin of data for other proof contexts.

Mechanisms keep track of the origin of data in each of a 
proof contexts fields by splitting it into subfields, to allow duplicated information to
be discarded when merging data from a number of proof contexts in a single field.
Each subfield is indexed by the proof context name from which it came.
This is also why we commit proof contexts, and why they may
only have data extracted for other proof contexts after their commital.
More than one proof context may be uncommitted at one time.

The data a user might enter into a proof context
is not in the same form as context-sensitive applications accessing the proof context wish to see:
there is an evaluation step in between.
We therefore must provide methods of evaluating the 
user data to extract the application data.
As we cannot in all cases state this evaluation process
at the point of implementing this document
we provide the functions prefixed $icl'set\_eval\_???$ to allow
evaluation functions to be entered at a later date.
Uncommitted proof contexts are evaluated by the current
evaluation function when they are pushed onto the proof context stack,
committed contexts are evaluated at the point of commital
by the evaluation functions current at the time of commital
(saving the cost of multiple evaluations upon multiple pushes).
\subsection{Summary of Tools Supported and Provided}
Three tools have context-sensitive  behaviour supported
by proof contexts:
=GFT
rewrite_tac and its cousins
strip_tac and its cousins
prove_∂_rule and its users
=TEX

The user data tools are:
=GFT
set_rw_eqn_cxt		get_rw_eqn_cxt
set_rw_canons		get_rw_canons
set_st_eqn_cxt		get_st_eqn_cxt
set_sg_eqn_cxt		get_sg_eqn_cxt
set_cs_∂_rule		get_cs_∂_rule
set_∂_cd_thm		get_∂_cd_thm
set_∂_vs_thm		get_∂_vs_thm
=TEX
In naming the interface functions we use the convention:
=GFT
<set|get>_<proof tool>_<modifier>
=TEX
The proof tools in the above are: $rw$ for rewriting,
$st$ for stripping theorems, $sg$ for stripping goals,
$cs$ for constant specifications,
and $∂$ for the existence prover $prove\-\_∂\-\_conv$.
$set$ and $get$ functions overwrite or access the database respectively.

The applications data tools are:
=GFT
icl'set_eval_ad_rw_net		current_ad_rw_net
icl'set_eval_ad_rw_canon		current_ad_rw_canon
icl'set_eval_ad_st_conv		current_ad_st_conv
icl'set_eval_ad_sg_conv		current_ad_sg_conv
icl'set_eval_ad_cs_∂_rule		current_ad_cs_∂_rule
icl'set_eval_ad_∂_cd_thm		current_ad_∂_cd_thm
icl'set_eval_ad_∂_vs_thm		current_ad_∂_vs_thm
=TEX
In naming the applications data interface functions we use the convention:
=GFT
<icl'set_eval|current>_ad_<proof tool>_<modifier>
=TEX
The proof tools in the above are: $rw$ for rewriting,
$st$ for stripping theorems, $sg$ for stripping goals,
$cs$ for constant specifications,
and $∂$ for the existence prover $prove\-\_∂\-\_conv$.
$icl'set\_eval$
sets the method of evaluating the associated user data into application data,
and $current$ gives the current proof contexts application data.

Note that the application data fields could be directly modified, to $v$ say,
by setting the evaluation function to 
=INLINEFT
(fn _ => v)
=TEX
, committing the proof context,
and restoring the evaluation function to its previous value.
This might be a system builder's necessary trick,
it is certainly not a standard pattern of use.

To allow certain patterns of context changes, we have
a stack of proof contexts, with the current proof context at the top.
We provide applications with hooks to look into this current proof
context,
but no way to modify stacked proof contexts ``in place''.
In particular, if a proof context is stacked, then it
is in fact a copy that is stacked, so that later changes to the original do not affect the stack.

The database of proof contexts is initialised to contain
a single context with key ``initial'', which is also the initial current proof context

=DOC
val €new_pc› : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$new\_pc$ $new$
creates a new 
entry with key $to$.
A note will be made of the current theory,
and its current definition level at the time of
creation, and an error will be raised
if an attempt is made to push the new proof context (see $push\_pc$) when
that theory is not in scope, or when the definition level
has been recorded as deleted.
The definition level will recorded as deleted if, e.g., some definition
or axiom that was in scope in the original theory has since been deleted.

One responsibility of the creator of a proof context is to ensure that the theorems used within, or created by, the new context are also
in scope: this is not automatically checked.
