\section{INTRODUCTION}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains the module tests associated with the 
theory of real numbers
required by \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD116} and
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP116}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
See \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD040}.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
The test material depends on \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD013},
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD035} and \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP114}.

\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.
\section{INITIALISATION}
Initialise the test package:
=SML
use_file "dtd013.sml";
use_file "imp013.sml";
init_mt_results ();
=TEX
\section{TEST CASES}
The organisation of the test cases is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Check the theory design
\item Test the syntax functions
\item Test the induction tactic
\item Test the computational conversions
\item Test the arithmetic normalisation conversion
\item Test the general purpose proof context
\item Test the linear arithmetic decision procedure
\item Regression tests for any fixes or enhancements ad lib
\end{enumerate}

\section{CHECK THE THEORY DESIGN}
=SML
use_file "dtd116.tch";
store_mt_results mt_run[("theory design for theory of reals",
	theory_check_success,
	(),
	true)];
=TEX
\section{UTILITIES}
=TEX
The following can be used to check a conversion for a specific known result.
If the conversion delivers a theorem with assumptions, or with a conclusion that
is not an equation with the given term as the lhs, it fails. Otherwise it returns
the rhs of the equation.
=SML
fun conv_rhs (conv : CONV) (tm : TERM) : TERM = (
	let	val thm = conv tm;
		val (lhs, rhs) = dest_eq(concl thm);
	in	if is_nil (asms thm) andalso tm =$ lhs
		then rhs
		else fail "conv_rhs" 7061 []

Now some more extensive tests for main computational conversions.
First of all we need some ML to check that signed literal results
are in the approved normal form:
=SML
fun ÛgcdÝ (m : INTEGER) (n : INTEGER) = (
	if	m @<= zero
	then	n
	else if	m @< n
	then	gcd (n imod m) m
	else if	m = n
	then	m
	else	gcd (m imod n) n
);
fun is_ok_lit (tm : TERM) : bool = (
	let	val (tm1, pos) = (dest_¯_minus tm, false) handle Fail _ => (tm, true);
	in	let	val i = dest_î(dest_î¯ tm1);
		in	pos orelse i <> zero
		end	handle Fail _ =>
		let	val (num, den) = (dest_î ** dest_î) (dest_¯_frac tm1);
		in	num <> zero andalso den <> one andalso gcd num den = one
		end	handle Fail _ => false
	end
);
=TEX
Now some glue so that we can check the results of a whole list of
conversion runs.
=SML
fun arith_conv_check (tm : TERM, th : THM) : bool = (
	let	val (lhs, rhs) = dest_eq(concl th);
	in	is_nil (asms th) andalso tm =$ lhs andalso is_ok_lit rhs
	end	handle Fail _ => false
);
fun chk_c (c : CONV) : TERM list -> (TERM * THM) list = (
	map (fn t => (t, c t))
);
fun arith_batch (tag : string) (c : CONV) (tms : TERM list) : (string * bool) list = (
	let	val labs = interval 1 (length tms);
		fun mk_tag i = tag ^ "." ^ string_of_int i;
	in	combine (map mk_tag labs) (map arith_conv_check (chk_c c tms))
	end
);
fun pred_conv_check (tm : TERM, th : THM) : bool = (
	let	val (lhs, rhs) = dest_eq(concl th);
	in	is_nil (asms th) andalso tm =$ lhs andalso (is_t rhs orelse is_f rhs)
	end	handle Fail _ => false
);
fun pred_batch (tag : string) (c : CONV) (tms : TERM list) : (string * bool) list = (
	let	val labs = interval 1 (length tms);
		fun mk_tag i = tag ^ "." ^ string_of_int i;
	in	combine (map mk_tag labs) (map pred_conv_check (chk_c c tms))
	end
);
