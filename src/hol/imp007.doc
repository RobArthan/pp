\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains an implementation of the derived rules of inference.
This includes user versions of the
primitive and built-in inference rules.
The design is in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD007}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains an implementation of the 
This includes user versions of the
primitive and built-in inference rules.
A ``primitive'' inference rule is considered to be part of the logic,
whereas a ``built-in'' rule is one that, though it could be coded in terms 
of the primitive rules, will actually be part of the abstract data type $THM$, and thus taken as holding true without checking.
These functions will be profiled with $prof$.
Inference rules other than these are called ``derived'' rules 
(derived from primitive and built-in rules).
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This document takes its signature from \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD007},
and also requires those files indicated as preceding it in the 
rel001 makefile.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
None known.
\subsubsection{Compilation Note}
\label{SplitStructure}

Issues~1.18 and earlier of this document declared a single structure,
by issue~1.18 this had almost~2300 lines of Standard~ML. Unfortunately
this structure failed to compile on Sun~3 computers although it did
compile on Sun~4 computers. Investigations failed to find the exact
cause of the compilation failure apart from a code generation limit was
exceeded.

The resolution of the compilation failure was to divide the structure
into two pieces, as follows.

=GFT SML example
structure DerivedInferenceRules = struct
	(* First set of declarations *)
	...
end;

structure ÛDerivedInferenceRulesÝ : DerivedInferenceRules = struct
	(* Second set of declarations *)
	open DerivedInferenceRules;
	...
end;

open DerivedInferenceRules;
=TEX

Here the two structures have the same name, there is a signature
constraint only on the second, the first structure is opened within the
second, the second structure declaration hides the first. The effect
is to create one structure having the required signature.

Two "proper" failures come from $mk\-\_app\-\_rule$,

\subsection{Concerning $T$}
Proof of $T$ (as 12.3.9)

We could work by a local theorem:

but choose to work by the more primitive route of 12.3.12

	val s8 = ´_intro mk_t thm;
	val s9 = ´_elim s5 s8;

end);
=TEX
In the following we could chose to try eliminating
all outermost $\ldots ¤ T$ and $T ¤ \ldots$.
D.I.Y. form:

=TEX
D.I.Y. form:

The following is out of sequence, but necessary at this point:
we first prove theorem:

\subsection{Concerning Matching Functions}
The function $apply\_matches\_rule$ encodes the matching attempt, should
a simple use of the rule fail.
It is given a term to match against,
a method of extracting the part to match,and the theorem
that is to be instantiated.
It presumes that the theorem it is passed is stripped
of all outer universal quantifers.
It brings up to the conclusion all the hypotheses.
It instantiates types to the minimum required,
instantiates free variables to the minimum required
(notice that we must not instantiate the universally quantified variables of $thm$ that occur free in the assumptions:
thus $tmm'$)
and then returns are the hypotheses to the assumption list.

The order of arguments to $@$ in $subs\_for$ is closely
tied to whether we do $inst\-\_term\-\_rule$
or $list\-\_simple\-\_µ\-\_elim$ first.

Note that $term\_match$ is not infallible.
