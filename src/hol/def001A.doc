\subsection{Notation for Syntax}

The notation used for grammars is BNF following the British
Standard~\cite{BS6154}.  The subset used may be summarised as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item   Individual terminal symbols are enclosed in single quotes (`~`~' and `~'~')
 E.g., `$let$'
\item   Terminal symbols standing for classes of symbols are represented
	by identifiers, as are nonterminal symbols E.g., $Name$
\item   Constructs to be concatenated are separated by a comma (`,')
\item   Optional constructs are enclosed in square brackets (`[' and
	`]')
\item   Constructs which may be repeated (zero or more times) are
	enclosed in braces (`\{' and `\}')
\item   Alternative constructs are separated by a vertical line
	(`$\vert$')
\item   Alternation has lower precedence than concatenation, but round
	brackets (`(' and `)') may be used to override this
\item	White space may be freely used, except within terminal and
	nonterminal symbols.
\end{itemize}

A syntax rule (referred to as a {\em production})
consists of: an identifier; an equals sign; a defining
construct, formed using the above rules; and a semicolon. A grammar
consists of a list of such rules.


Comments in the grammar are bracketed with `$(*$' and `$*)$'.
