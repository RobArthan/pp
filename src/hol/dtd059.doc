\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
Tools for introducing HOL product types are 
called for to support introduction of Z schemas, etc, called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD016}.
The tools are directly called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD010}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the
tools to introduce HOL product types.
Unlike constant specification (See $const\_spec$)
there is no requirement for an ``axiom'' mode, where instead
of proof required theorems are introduced by axiom.
This is because all the proof work can always be completed,
and if the relevant cached theorem is present, it can be
completed fast.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This document depends upon \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP027}.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
None known.

signature ÛProductTypesÝ  = sig
=DESCRIBE
This is the signature of a structure supporting the introduction of HOL product types.
=ENDDOC
\section{THE DESIGN}
=DOC
val ÛHOL_lab_prod_recogniserÝ : string * string * string * Lex.INPUT list * string
	-> THM;
=DESCRIBE
This function is called by the reader writer and should
not be called by a user directly. The first and second arguments
are the start symbol for the recogniser and the language name. The
third argument is the name of the type, which appears as the argument.
to ¹HOLLABPROD. The fourth argument is the HOL term represented in
a form understood by the lexical analyser. The last argument is the
terminating symbol, and should always be a ``°''.
The name of the type and the parsed input is passed to
$labelled\_product\_spec$ (q.v.)
which will attempt the requested specification.
The keys under which the result will be saved are just the names 
of the variables concerned.

This may also save a theorem concerning tuples to the current cache theory (see $get\_cache\_theory$).
=USES
As an interface between the HOL reader/writer and $labelled\-\_product\-\_spec$ - it is not intended for
direct use.
It is used to process text of the form, e.g.,
=GFTXQ Example Labelled Product Specification
 ¹HOLLABPROD TYNAME
	decl decl;
	decl decl; decl

=FAILURE
59000	Input not of right form

Errors from $labelled\_product\_spec$ may also occur: the messages area of origin will not be changed.

val Ûlabelled_product_specÝ:{tyname:string, tykey:string, conname:string, 
	constkeys:string list, labels:(string*TYPE)list, tyvars:(TYPE list)OPT} -> THM;
=DESCRIBE
This function
introduces a labelled product type, and its constructor and projection functions.
Its argument's fields are:
\begin{description}
\item [tyname]
The name of the new type.
\item [tykey]
The key under which the defining theorem for the type will be saved.
\item [conname]
The name of the single constructor of the new type.
It will be a curried function, from each of the label types, in turn, to the new type.
\item [constkeys]
The keys under which the defining theorem for the 
constructor $conname$ and projection functions will be saved.
\item [labels]
The list of the names and types of the labelled fields in the new type. 
A projection function will be defined for each label,
a single defining theorem for all will be saved under the keys $constkeys$.
It is this defining theorem that is the result of the function call.
\item [tyvars]
If this field is $Nil$ then the type variables in the new type will be ordered as their occurrence in $labels$, otherwise as stated by this parameter.
\end{description}
If the appropriate tuple theorem is not already in scope a call of $cached\-\_labelled\-\_product\-\_rule$ $(length$ $labels)$ will also be made as a side effect.
=EXAMPLE
:> labelled_product_spec {tyname="PAIR", tykey="PAIR", conname="Comma",
	constkeys=["Comma","First","Second","pair_ops_def"], 
		labels=[("First",”'f®),("Second",”'s®)], tyvars=Value[”'s®,”'f®]};
will cause	ô ¶ f : ('s, 'f) PAIR ­ ('f ¸ 's) · TypeDefn (Ì x · T) f
to be saved under the key "PAIR", and the following
		ô µ t · µ (x1:'f) (x2:'s)· 
		First(Comma x1 x2) = x1 ± 
		Second(Comma x1 x2) = x2) ± 
		Comma(First t) (Second t) = t
under keys "Comma", "First", "Second" and "pair_ops_def", and returned as the result
=FAILURE
59010	Must be at least one label in list
59014	Failed to introduce type and operators for ?0
59015	Some labels are given types containing type variables not found in 
	supplied list of type variables, being: ?0
59018	May not use key ?0 for both type and constructor definition
=FAILUREC
Also as the appropriate errors of $cached\-\_labelled\-\_product\-\_rule$, $new\-\_type\-\_defn$ and $new\-\_speci\-fication$.
Error 59014 suggests a corrupted cache theorem.
=ENDDOC

Interestingly, the result of the above is in the right form for the theorem used as an argument for $set\_¶\_vs\_thms$.
=DOC
val Ûunlabelled_product_specÝ : {tyname:string, tykey:string, conname:string, 
	conkeys:string list, tyi:TYPE list, tyvars:(TYPE list)OPT} -> THM;
=DESCRIBE
This function introduces an unlabelled product type
Its argument's fields are:
\begin{description}
\item [tyname]
The name of the new type.
\item [tykey]
The key under which the defining theorem for the type will be saved.
\item [conname]
The name of the single constructor of the new type.
It will be a curried function, from each of the types $tyi$, in turn, to the new type.
\item [conkeys]
The keys under which the defining theorem for the 
constructor $conname$ will be saved.
\item [tyi]
The list of the types of the fields in the new type. 
\item [tyvars]
If this field is $Nil$ then the type variables in the new type will be ordered as their occurrence in $labels$, otherwise as stated by this parameter.
\end{description}

If the appropriate tuple theorem is not already in scope a call of $cached\-\_unlabelled\-\_product\-\_rule$ $(length$ $tyi)$ will also be made as a side effect.
This is as part of the speeding up of introducing the new type.
=EXAMPLE
:> unlabelled_product_spec {tyname="UPAIR", tykey="UPAIR", conname="UComma",
	conkeys=["UComma","ucomma_def"], tyi=[”'f®, ”'s®], tyvars=Nil};
will cause
ô ¶ f : ('f, 's) UPAIR ­ ('f ¸ 's) · TypeDefn (Ì x · T) f
to be saved under the key "UPAIR", and
ô 	(µ (x1:'f) (x2:'s)· µ y1 y2·
	(UComma x1 x2 = UComma y1 y2) ¤ (x1 = y1) ± (x2 = y2))
	± (µ t · ¶ x1 x2 · t = UComma x1 x2)

to be saved under the keys "UComma" and "ucomma_def", and returned as the result

is quite deliberate, and necessary for fast processing.
=DOC
val Ûcached_labelled_product_ruleÝ : int -> THM;
=DESCRIBE
$cached\-\_labelled\_product\-\_rule$ $n$ proves a theorem about an n-tuple,
where $n$ is some positive integer.
This states that if some type is isomorphic to an n-tuple
(an iterated binary product)
then a constructor, and projection functions exist for this type.
The theorem will be stored in the current cache theory (see $get\-\_cache\-\_theories$)
under the key ``nCachedLabelledProduct'',
unless $n\ =\ 1$, when it is ``built-it''.
However, if the theorem desired is already in a cache theory in scope, then it
just returns the stored existence theorem.

For storing the theorem current cache theory will be found by $force\-\_get\-\_cache\-\_theory$.
If no writable cache theory is in scope this will attempt
to
use $new_parent$ to bring one in scope, and failing that will declare the current theory to be a cache theory.
=EXAMPLE
> cached_labelled_product_rule 2;

ô  (¶ abs rep · (µ a · abs(rep a) = a) ± (µ r · rep(abs r) = r))

val Ûset_cache_theoriesÝ : string list -> string list;
val Ûget_cache_theoryÝ : unit -> string;
val Ûforce_get_cache_theoryÝ : unit -> string;
val Ûget_cache_theoriesÝ : unit -> string list;
val Ûget_valid_cache_theoriesÝ : unit -> string list;
=DESCRIBE
These functions provide the interface to
the list of cache theories.
$set\-\_cache\-\_theories$ stores an uninterpreted
list of strings, that are intended to be theory names,
returning the previous setting.

The current cache theory is the first string of the cache theory list 
which is a theory name that is in scope and writable
(not locked, an ancestor, or below sealing by $icl'seal\-\_hierarchy$).
This is the cache theory that should be {\bf written} to
as a cache.
This is accessed by $get\-\_cache\-\_theory$ which will fail if there is no such theory.

$force\-\_get\-\_cache\-\_theory$ will search for the current cache theory as $get\-\_cache\-\_theory$.
However, if it can find none then it will first attempt to create one by
trying $new\_parent$ on each of the writable cache theories that are out of scope.
If this fails, then it will make the current theory an additional cache theory if it is writable.

$get\_cache\_theories$ returns the uninterpreted list of strings
last set as the cache theories by $set\-\_cache\-\_theories$.

The current cache theories are the names in the cache theory list of in-scope theories (that need not be writable):
this function may return the empty list.
This list is accessed by $get\_valid\_cache\_theories$

The scope and existence of the cache theories is determined at the point of applying the
function names to $()$.

These functions support a method of working using cache theories, where
only a subset of the ancestors of the current theory are searched
for particular portions of contents,
and these things are only stored in the current cache theory.
This will speed the search for these items by such functions as
$cached\-\_labelled\-\_product\-\_rule$.
=FAILURE
59002	There is no in scope, writable, cache theory
59008	Unable to bring a writable cache theory into scope
	and current theory not writable
=ENDDOC

At some later date we may wish to add in an auxiliary function that indicates
how much further work is required in producing cached theorems,
so as to allow some indication of the expected delay to be passed onto the user in a manner chosen by the calling function.
