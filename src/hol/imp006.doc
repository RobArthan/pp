\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains an implementation of the abstract data type $THM$.
This includes its
primitive and built-in inference rules,
and its theory management material.
This is called for in section 4 of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD007}.
The high-level specification for the code is
given in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC003}, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC004} and \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC005}.
The design is in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD006}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains an implementation of the 
abstract data type $THM$.
This includes its
primitive and built-in inference rules,
and its theory management material.
A ``primitive'' inference rule is considered to be part of the logic,
whereas a built-in rule is one that, though it could be coded in terms 
of the primitive rules, will actually be part of the abstract data type $THM$, and thus taken as holding true without checking.

We have to assume that single assignments cannot be interrupted,
but that any sequence of commands may be.
We need to maintain consistency between certain parts of state,
and thus we have some protected functions,
see section \ref{Inconsistent}.

When handling hierarchies it should be borne in mind that
the only function that may change the address of the current
hierarchy is $icl'load\_hierarchy$.
This is so that the addresses in $icl'new\_hierarchy$
remain current until the next $icl'load\_hierarchy$. 
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This document takes its signature from \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD006},
and also requires those files indicated as preceding it in the 
rel001 makefile.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
None known.

\section{INTERRUPTS AND INCONSISTENCY}
\label{Inconsistent}
There are three activities we sometimes wish to do in uninterruptable combinations.
Interrupts might be, for instance, due to the user pressing Control-C, or the program running out of machine resources.
\begin{description}
\item[1]
``In place'' modification of $icl'THEORY\_INFO$s within the hierarchy, using the fact that the hierarchy is an (imperative-style) array and using array assignment.
\item[2]
Changes to the current state, other than ``in place''. 
In particular, modifications to the type and constructor environments $ty\-\_env$ and $con\-\_env$.
\item[3]
Assignments to the current theory address, to update the theory rather than change the theory that is current.
\end{description}
If combinations of these were interrupted they might lead to some of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The type or constructor environments containing items that are not actually within any theory in scope.
This can cause theorems to be apparently valid, when in fact they are not.
\item
The type or constructor environments failing to contain items that are actually within some theory in scope.
This could allow the redefinition of such things while theorems concerning
the old definition are still in scope
(and are made valid once more by the redefinition placing the items in the type or constructor environment).
\item
A theory may have another as parent that does not record its child in its $children$ field
(we take the $parents$ field as definitive).
This would allow the parent to declare things that clashed with its child's contents, and would sometimes allow the parent to be deleted
leaving an orphan.
\item
A theory may indicate it has another as a child, while the so-called child does not record the other as parent.
This will cause the parent to be unable to redefine things present in the so-called child that strictly it should be able to do.
This is not inconsistent, but only inconvenient.
\item 
Having the $inscope$ fields inconsistent with the current theory and the parentage relation has the same problems as the $children$ field being inconsistent.
If the $inscope$ fields are inconsistent with the type and constant environments
then this will give rise to the same problems as if those are
inconsistent with the theory's contents.
\end{itemize}
These problems could occur in the following functions,
the numbers in brackets refer to the kind of changes made: 1, 2, or 3.

\begin{tabular}{| l | p{4.7in}|}\hline
Function & Combination \\ \hline
$icl'open\_theory$ & Multiple ``in place'' modifications to the hierarchy and environments, and a change of address for the current theory(1,2). \\
$icl'delete\_theory$ & Multiple ``in place'' modifications to the hierarchy: the deleted theory, and its parents. Can also leave
some garbage if interrupted(1). \\
$icl'new\_theory$ & Two ``in place'' modifications to the hierarchy
(the new theory and parent) (1). \\
$icl'duplicate\_theory$ & Multiple ``in place'' modifications to the hierarchy
(new theory and its parents)(1). \\
$icl'freeze\_hierarchy$ & Multiple ``in place'' modifications to the hierarchy
(all theories)(1). \\
$delete\_extension$ & Deletions from environments and an assignment to current theory address(2,3). \\
$icl'new\_const$ & Addition to constant environment and an assignment to current theory address(2,3). \\
$icl'new\_type$ & Addition to type environment and an assignment to current theory address(2,3). \\
$icl'new\_defn$ & Addition to constant environment and an assignment to current theory address(2,3). \\
$icl'new\_type\_defn$ & Addition to type environment and an assignment to current theory address(2,3). \\
$icl'new\_spec$ & Additions to constant environment and an assignment to current theory address(2,3). \\
$icl'new\_parent$ & Additions to constant and type environments, an assignment to current theory address, and ``in place'' modifications to the hierarchy (new parent and current theory)(2,3). \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

These problems occur because we maintain ``value added'' copies of 
definitive information, usually to increase speed.
One solution would be to eliminate the copies, and accept the time
cost: this seems an unreasonable deal, and might not solve the 
problem.
Another solution would be to maintain a backup of the entire system
to be reverted to in the case of an error. 
This would have a time penalty, would have to be careful in
avoiding introducing inconsistencies, and might be vulnerable to multiple interrupts.

We choose as a solution the introduction of a boolean flag in $HIERARCHY$ (q.v.),
that is set on entering a block of code that is dangerous if interrupted,
and reset on exiting normally.
An interrupt will leave the flag set.
All validity checkers, in particular $check\_thm$ (q.v)
and $check\_c\_writable$
(``check current theory writable'', q.v.),
will check the flag, and if it is set then the validity check will fail.
Thus an unfortunately timed interrupt could render the system ``you can look, but you can't touch''.
This is indicated by the error message:

The following is a function to give the maximum of a list of numbers.
The maximum of n empty list is $0$ (could be made a fail).

	if sf < p
	then aux p q
	else aux sf q
	) | aux sf [] = sf;
in
	aux a x
end);

Give a list of HOL type variables $'1, '2,\ldots$:
=SML
fun ÛntyvarsÝ (n : int) : TYPE list = (
	map (fn x=> mk_vartype("'"^string_of_int x))
		(interval 1 n)

	else two_the_same x
) | two_the_same _ = error "two_the_same" 6032 [];

\subsubsection{Ranges}
We are interested in supporting ranges of deleted levels,
but the code can be given in isolation from
the type of theories.

We are interested in a list of numbers,
\[ [ (a_{1},\ b_{1}),\ (a_{2},\ b_{2}),\ ...,\ (a_n,\ b_n)]\]
where $b_{i-1}$ is always less than $a_i$,
$0\ <\ a_1$, 
and $a_i$ is always less than or equal to $b_i$.

First, we wish to check whether a number fails inside any of the ranges $a_i$ to $b_i$.
=SML
fun Ûrange_memÝ (v : int, [] : (int * int)list) = false
| range_mem (v, ((a,b) :: x)) = (
	(v >= a) andalso 
	((v <= b) orelse range_mem(v, x))
);
=TEX
Second, we wish to extend the range by adding (a,b), which may enclose other ranges.
=SML
fun Ûextend_rangeÝ (a:int,b:int) ([]:(int * int)list): (int * int)list= (
	[(a,b)]
) | extend_range (a,b) (lst as ((a1,b1) :: x)) = (
let
	fun fixb lw (lst1 as ((a2,b2) :: x1)) = (
		if b + 1 < a2
		then ((lw,b) :: lst1)
		else if b <= b2
		then ((lw,b2) :: x1)
		else fixb lw x1
	) | fixb lw [] = [(lw,b)];
in
	if a < a1 
	then fixb a lst
	else if b1+1 < a
	then ((a1,b1) :: extend_range (a,b) x)	
	else fixb a1 lst
end);
=IGN
val p = [(1,2), (6,8), (10,10), (12,13)];
extend_range (0,3) p;
extend_range (4,4) p;
extend_range (5,5) p;
extend_range (11,15) p;
extend_range (11,11) p;

=TEX
We will use the sparse array material of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD001}
=SML
open SparseArray;
=TEX
\subsection{Types of the ADT $THM$}
A fragment of some user data, and a collection of such
fragments:
=SML
datatype ÛUSER_DATUMÝ =
	ÛUD_TermÝ of TERM * (USER_DATUM list) |
	ÛUD_TypeÝ of TYPE * (USER_DATUM list) |
	ÛUD_StringÝ of string * (USER_DATUM list) |
	ÛUD_IntÝ of int * (USER_DATUM list);

type ÛUSER_DATAÝ = (USER_DATUM ref) S_DICT;
=TEX
The type of sequents:
=SML
type ÛSEQÝ = TERM list * TERM;
=TEX
The type of the theory status:
=SML
datatype ÛTHEORY_STATUSÝ =
	ÛTSNormalÝ | ÛTSLockedÝ | ÛTSAncestorÝ | ÛTSDeletedÝ;
=TEX
=SML
abstype ÛTHMÝ = ÛThmÝ of {
		level : int,
		theory : icl'THEORY ref, 
		sequent : SEQ}

	Ûicl'THEORYÝ = ÛThyÝ of {

	Ûicl'THEORY_INFOÝ = ÛThyInfoÝ of {
		status : THEORY_STATUS,
		inscope : bool,
		contents : icl'THEORY ref,
		children : int list,
		name : string}
and
=TEX
In a hierarchy there will be:
\begin{itemize}
\item
A boolean flag which is $false$ if the hierarchy is consistent, and true otherwise.
If a new hierarchy is loaded then the new consistency will be the new flag alone. 
I.e. the new hierachy is not necessarily recorded as inconsistent if the old one was.
\item
An array of theory information blocks.
This will contain theories with internal names $0$ to length of array, though some may have the status ``deleted''.
\end{itemize}
=SML

\subsection{The Interface Theory Type}

\subsection{The State Type}
$sealed$ is the integer index of the sealed theory.

	else aux (a2 :: acc) x2
	) | aux acc [] = (false, []);

	val (ok,res) = aux [] l2;
in
	ok andalso (sequal eq (x1 drop (fn v => eq(v, a1))) res)
end);

fun ((asms1,conc1):SEQ) Û=#Ý ((asms2,conc2):SEQ) = (

\subsection{The Initial State}
The following is a function to give an empty theory, for initialisation
or deletion purposes.
The $pnts$ (for ``parents'') are given as a list type to give a simple ``optional'' value method.
=SML
fun Ûempty_theoryÝ (nm: int) (pnts : int list) : icl'THEORY = (
	Thy{name = nm,

	 del_levels = [],
	 axiom_dict = initial_s_dict,
	 defn_dict = initial_s_dict,
	 thm_dict = initial_s_dict,
	 current_level = 0,
	 user_data = ref initial_s_dict}
);
=TEX
The following is initialises the ``current state'', which is a $ref$ variable called $current$.
Initially it contains the empty theory "min" (with index 0), alone, as the current theory, which is also the sealed theory, with empty environments
(except that the constant environment always contains the numeric, string and character literal constants).

=SML
local
	val min = ref (empty_theory 0 []);

	val min_ti = ThyInfo{status = TSNormal,
		inscope = true,
		contents = min,
		children = [],
		name = "ÛminÝ"};

	val init_hier_ia : icl'THEORY_INFO SPARSE_ARRAY = array 100;

	val dummy = update(init_hier_ia, 0, min_ti);

	val init_hier : icl'HIERARCHY =

		sealed = 0};
end;

Pointers into the current state:
=SML
fun Ûcurrent_hierarchyÝ (():unit) : icl'HIERARCHY = (
let	val {hierarchy=hierarchy,...} = !current

fun Ûcurrent_theoryÝ (():unit) : icl'THEORY = (
let	val {theory=theory,...} = !current

\subsection{The Scope of Types and Constants}
We will need to be able to rapidly check where HOL terms, types
and their derivatives are well-formed.
Well-formedness is just that the HOL type constructors and constants are in scope, with the right usage.
To do this efficiently we need a fast lookup facility for
type constructors and constants in scope.

Remove a simple dictionaries worth of constructor
information from an $E\_DICT$:
=SML
fun Ûdel_con_envÝ (lst:{ty:TYPE, level:int} S_DICT) 
	(edict:{ty:TYPE, level:int} E_DICT): {ty:TYPE, level:int} E_DICT = (

\subsubsection{Well-formedness}
The following are functions to check whether a type, term or theorem is well-formed within the current scope:
they give rise to an appropriate error message if not.

We choose to make a set of all types and constants to be checked,
and then check each set member, rather than check all generated
items, as this is judged superior in speed.

\subsubsection{Theory Names}
$icl'get\_current\_theory\_name$ is part of the ADT interface,
but it is useful in defining utilities, so we provide it ``out of sequence''.

Get the current theory's name as an integer:

Check that an internal name falls within the range 0 to length of array, failing if not, with area being the $caller$ parameter:

Given a theory name as an string, the following function returns its internal name as an integer.

\subsubsection{Checking Writability}
We give a check that the current theory status allows writing, with various fail messages if not.
Note that the current theory should never have status $TSDeleted$.

We need a test to see if $hir1$ hierarchy is an ``ancestor'' of $hir2$.
According to the specification, this is so if the child possesses all the ancestors theories (by address comparison),

As new theories are always added to the ``tail'' of the theory hierarchy array we need only test up to the top theory of the ``ancestor''
hierarchy.

\section{THEORY AND HIERARCHY FUNCTIONS OF ADT THM}
\subsection{Operations on Hierarchies}
These functions follow the specification of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC005}.

The following sets all non-deleted theories to have 
status TSancestor.
=SML
fun Ûicl'freeze_hierarchyÝ () : unit = (
let	val {hierarchy=hierarchy as hier(inconsistent,lookup), theory=theory, ty_env=ty_env, 
		con_env=con_env, sealed=sealed, ...} = !current;
	val dummy = if !inconsistent

		else ();
	fun make_anc (n , ThyInfo{status = status,
				inscope = inscope,

					then TSDeleted
					else TSAncestor),
				inscope = inscope,

	val was_inconsistent = !inconsistent;

	inconsistent := true;

	map_hierarchy make_anc hierarchy; (* spec. step 1 *)

	inconsistent := was_inconsistent;
		(* spec. step 2 *)
	() 
end);
=TEX

The following function gives the process of creating a new hierarchy from the current one,
but fails if any ancestor has status other than 
$TSancestor$ or $TSdeleted$. 
We first take a copy, we then modify its contents by reference,
we then make the current state have this new hierarchy as its current
one, as well as returning this value.
=SML
fun Ûicl'new_hierarchyÝ () : icl'HIERARCHY = (
let	val {hierarchy=hierarchy as hier(inconsistent,lookup), theory=theory, ty_env=ty_env, 
		con_env=con_env, sealed=sealed, ... } = !current;
	val dummy = if !inconsistent
		then error "icl'new_hierarchy" 6083 []
		else ();
	fun test_anc (n , ti as ThyInfo{status = status,
				inscope = inscope,
				contents = contents,
				children = children,
				name = name})
		=
		if (status <> TSDeleted) andalso (status <> TSAncestor)
		then fail "icl'new_hierarchy" 6090 [fn () => string_of_int n]
		else ti;

	val hcopy = copy_hierarchy hierarchy;

	val dummy = map_hierarchy test_anc hcopy; (* spec. step ? *)

in
	hcopy (* spec. step ? *)
end);
=TEX
Now we give a ``load hierarchy'' function, as demanded by the specification.
As the current theory address doesn't change, and its contents and its ancestors are
equal, $ty\_env$ and $con\_env$ and the theorem, definition and axiom dictionaries do not change.
The specification step 1 is irrelevant to our style of
implementation.

First a function, used with $map\_hierarchy$ to match the new hierarchies $inscope$ flags to the existing ones, or set them false.
After applying this only the $children$ field of the overlap
might differ, and the differences can only be aditional children in the new hierarchy.

We do not load the new hierarchy if either the new or the old are inconsistent.
