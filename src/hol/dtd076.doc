\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
Various proof contexts are called for in Appendix A
of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD011}.
This document provides a detailed design for these contexts.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
The mechanism of proof contexts is discussed in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD009}, and is implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD051}.
There are however many proof contexts provided within 
the HOL PDS, implemented in various subsystems.
The sum of these should provide a coherent set,
with some proof contexts being appropriate
to be pushed onto the proof context stack in their
own right, and others allowing detail in creating
proof contexts based in part on existing context material.

This document describes the proof contexts supplied for 
theories up to ``hol''.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This documents proof contexts require
theories $hol$ and $sets$ (thus \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP044})
and structures $Resolution$ and $ExistenceProofs$
(thus \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP058} and \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP067}).
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
The implementation of this document is the first place
we can usefully commit proof contexts that are
to be supplied to the user, as we need, e.g. the
resolution tool kit in place.
However, we need proof contexts during the system build
before this point,
and for module tests of partial builds (i.e. builds that failed
to build some dependency of this document and its implementation).
Thus uncommitted, incomplete proof contexts are introduced
earlier in the build, matching only some of the fields of
the proof context designs given in
this document.
Thus many implementation documents use
proof contexts that are incomplete versions of those described
here, and module tests requiring proof contexts
only use those proof contexts
that must be present, if perhaps incomplete, for their associated
implementation to have been possible.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
A helpful characterization of the problems that $prove\_tac$, etc, can be
usefully applied to
could be given for each proof context.
Unfortunately, a more detailed charactisation than ``does most of the obvious simplifications in that context of reasoning''
is difficult to provide without just stating the algorithm used by $prove\-\_tac$.

\section{DESIGN ISSUES}
A proof context is made visible to the user for one of
two reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
It is a useful proof context to make the current proof context in its own right - a ``complete proof context''.
It provides appropriate material for reasoning in a particular ``place of work'' within the theory hierarchy.
For instance, the proof context set by the system build process as
the current one, ``hol'',
falls into this category.

A naive user will be first exposed to this kind of proof context.
\item
The proof context contains appropriate material for one subject
(characteristically a theory, and a way of reasoning within that theory), and is used in creating
custom proof contexts from the merge of pre-existing
ones  (and perhaps new material).
This is called a ``component proof context''.
\end{enumerate}
A supplied complete proof context will be primarily be result of  merging some component proof contexts,
with perhaps some additional material reflecting the completeness.
This additional material will be kept to a minimum in
supplied complete proof contexts.

By convention, component proof context names will start with a prime, and all proof context names will be lower case, with name atoms
separated by underscores.

There will not be a complete proof context for each possible ``place of work'',
but just sufficient to cover the ``places of work'' recommended to the naive user.

One distinction that can be drawn between proof contexts is their level of ``aggression'': they may be referred to as ``mild'' or ``aggressive''.
A ``mild'' proof context is designed to only do things
that are considered to be ``always'' wanted - e.g. standard
rewriting simplification for the subject of the proof context.
An aggressive proof context will be written with the aim of 
``prove if possible'', and will not ``care'' about 
the results upon items that cannot be proven by proof context alone.
This includes aggressive use of extensionality of functions and sets.

Roughly, the relationship in supplied proof contexts between stripping material and rewriting
material is that the stripping is a subset
of rewriting material that deals with boolean valued terms.
Other differences arise when precise forms of conclusion
are required to aid further stripping - this
is most apparent in proof context ``predicates''.
\section{THE SIGNATURE}
=DOC
signature €ProofContexts1› = sig
=DESCRIBE
This signature gives access to two functions used in
supplying the first group of proof contexts.
Proof contexts themselves have no entry in the signature,
however the contexts provided are:

\subsection{Utilities}
The following provide useful default values
for two fields of a proof context.
=DOC
val €basic_prove_tac› : THM list -> TACTIC;
=DESCRIBE
This is the tactic used for the automated proof tactic (the $pr\_tac$ field) of most
supplied proof contexts,
and is a reasonable, general-purpose, automatic proof tactic.

In summary it will:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Extract the assumption list, rewrite each extracted assumption with the current
default rewrite rules and given theorems, and strip the results back into the assumption list.
\item
Attempt to rewrite the resulting goal's conclusions with the current
default rewrite rules and given theorems.
\item
Repeatedly apply $strip\_tac$ to the conclusions of the resulting goals.
\item
Attempt to prove each of the resulting goals with resolution for up to 3 resolution steps, with goal's negated conclusion
as a resolvant that must be used, and the assumptions as possible
other resolvants.
This has no effect on any resulting goal if it is unsolved.
\item
Attempt to prove each of the resulting goals with resolution for up to 3 resolution steps amongst
just the assumptions.
This has no effect on any resulting goal if it is unsolved.
\end{enumerate}

Note that either stripping step may result in more than one subgoal, and thus the plural ``resulting goals''.

Under the current interface to
resolution this is
=GFT
fun basic_prove_tac thms =
DROP_ASMS_T (MAP_EVERY (strip_asm_tac o rewrite_rule thms) o rev) THEN
(TRY_T (rewrite_tac thms)) THEN
REPEAT strip_tac THEN_TRY
(basic_res_tac2 3 [Ù µ x ∑ x = x] 
 ORELSE_T basic_res_tac3 3 [Ù µ x ∑ x = x])
=TEX
=ENDDOC
The ``3 resolution steps'' is a fixed number of steps, chosen as a compromise between finding all possible resolution proofs
and the costs of such attempts.
For finer tuning, use the resolution package more directly.
=DOC
val €basic_prove_conv› : THM list -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This is the conversion used for the automatic proof conversion ($pr\_tac$ field) of most
supplied proof contexts,
and is a reasonable, general-purpose, automatic proof conversion.
It will either prove the theorem with the given conclusion, or fail.

In summary it will:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Set the term as the goal of the subgoal package.
\item
Attempt to rewrite the term with the current
default rewrite rules and given theorems.
\item
Repeatedly apply $strip\_tac$ to the goal.
\item
Attempt to prove the resulting goals with resolution for up to 3 resolution steps, with goal's negated conclusion
as a resolvant that must be used, and the assumptions as possible
other resolvants.
This has no effect on any resulting goal if it is unsolved.
\item
Attempt to prove the resulting goals with resolution for up to 3 resolution steps amongst
just the assumptions.
This has no effect on any resulting goal if it is unsolved.
\item
If the proof is successful, return 
=INLINEFT
Ù term § T
=TEX
{} and otherwise fail.
\end{enumerate}

Note that in the stripping step may result in more than one subgoal, and thus the plural ``resulting goals''.

Under the current interface to
resolution this is
=GFT
fun basic_prove_conv thms tm =
§_t_intro (
tac_proof(([],tm),
	TRY_T (rewrite_tac thms)  THEN 
	REPEAT strip_tac THEN_TRY
	(basic_res_tac2 3 [Ù µ x ∑ x = x] 
	 ORELSE_T basic_res_tac3 3 [Ù µ x ∑ x = x]))
)

\subsection{The Actual Proof Contexts}
In the following the initial paragraph indicates whether
the proof context is complete or a component,
and its ``place of work'' or subject;
the ``Contents'' paragraph indicates the contents, perhaps
with reference to previous component or complete proof contexts;
and the ``Usage'' paragraph indicates the minimum theories
required in scope, and interactions with other proof contexts.
In stating the contents of fields entered into discrimination
nets the index into the net will be,
unless otherwise stated, the least general index
that matches all applications of the item.
=DOC
(* Proof Context: €'basic_prove_∂_conv› *)
=DESCRIBE
A component proof context that adds the function 
$basic\_prove\_∂\_conv$ as an automatic existence prover.
\paragraph{Contents}

Automatic proof procedures are respectively ``always fail tactic'', ``always fail conversion'',
 and $basic\-\_prove\-\_∂\-\_conv$.

\paragraph{Usage Notes}
Requires theory ``basic\_hol'', intended to be combined into 
the merge of any component proof contexts that do not have
their own special existence prover.
It should usually be the first in the list of proof contexts
to be merged together, so that other proof contexts  may 
introduce pre-processors, and then the final default
prover is invoked.
This is because the standard application of the list
of existence prover conversions is defined to be to apply them in a cumulative manner, in reverse order.

Automatic proof procedures are respectively $basic\-\_prove\-\_tac$,
$basic\-\_prove\-\_conv$ and no existence prover.

\paragraph{Usage Notes}
Requires theory $one$.
As when entered into the rewriting net the rewriting theorems will match any term presented to the net, this proof context will 
slow down rewriting.

In the above $comb\_s\_def$ seems less appropriate as an ``always rewriter'' as the number of symbols after rewriting, even if the arguments to $CombS$
are variables, only remains the same.

the existence prover preprocessor:

as function application in some cases.
\paragraph{Usage Notes}
Should not be used with proof context ``$'$sets$\_$ext'', requires theory $sets$.

Theorem $ö\_clauses$ is covered by the other
$?\_clauses$ material, and anyway is not currently complete,
and so is not included.
$sets\_clauses$ has some overlap with other theorems in the proof context.

\subsection{TEST POLICY}
The integration tests for this subsystem are to follow the general
guidelines laid down in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008}.

Testing of proof contexts is done primarily to
demonstrate presence, rather than correct functioning.
This is because the proof contexts will be built from tools and theorems
that are better tested directly.
