\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
abstract data type $THM$.
This includes its
primitive and built-in inference rules,
and its theory management material.
This is called for in section 4 of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD007}.
The high-level specification for the code is
given in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC003}, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC004} and \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC005}.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP006}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
abstract data type $THM$.
This includes its
primitive and built-in inference rules,
and its theory management material.
None of the material, other than certain types, is for other than ICL use, and thus most description boxes merely state this.
This is indicated by using the $icl'$ prefix in the names.

The functions provided in this document allow the implementation
of a theory tools interface document \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD012},
and a derived inference rule document \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD007}.
Those two documents contain only non-critical code,
and should be the only direct use made of the material given a design
in this document.
This is because a design goal for this document has been to minimise the functions provided within the
abstract data type for theorems (which is critical code), while still providing enough
to allow the implementation of a fast set of interfaces
(non-critical code).
To this end we only note the signatures of the functions, and that the functions should not be used by other than ICL,
in documentation boxes, with signatures grouped by subsection.

We wish to reserve the potential for various forms of notification to occur by side effect whenever a theory is modified.
These notification mechanisms are to be provided outside of the
abstract data type $THM$.
Thus we prefix the names all functions that modify the theory database with $icl'$,
for all that in some cases initial implementations may set the user interface
functions just to equal the ones provided in this document.
We also give an $icl'$ prefix to any function we gather
profile information about, as the profiling is better done outside the Abstract Data Type.

A ``primitive'' inference rule is considered to be part of the logic,
whereas a built-in rule is one that, though it could be coded in terms 
of the primitive rules, will actually be part of the abstract data type $THM$, and thus taken as holding true without being checked by using the primitive rules.

All functions require all their arguments before they can be evaluated,
unless otherwise noted.
This is in contrast to functions which may be ``partially evaluated'' with less than their full compliment of arguments.
For instance $icl'subst\_rule$ will check the well-formedness of its
list argument, and break apart the equational theorems within the list, even if not applied to the further two arguments
it requires to derive a theorem.
Thus it is said that we may partially evaluate $icl'subst\_rule$ with one argument.

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Loading this document is dependent on \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP003}.

This document is placing requirements on the properties of the
constants it invokes.
The following constants have their definition specified in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC003}:
$µ$, $¶$, $TypeDefn$ (as $Type\_Definition$).
$=$ and $´$ are given their properties by the primitive inference rules, rather than by definition.
$¤$ is later declared (in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP023})
as an alias for boolean equality, and thus all functions that handle equality will 
properly handle terms and theorems containing $¤$.
Thus $¤$ is only used in this document when specific reference is intended to boolean equality.

The remaining constants: $Suc$, $Zero$, $Mod$, $Div$, $Cons$,
$Nil$, and $AbsChar$, are given their properties in
the declarations of theories $î$, $list$ and $char$.

\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
None known.
\subsubsection{Terminology}
The following supplements the terminology used in those documents
upon which this one depends.
\begin{tabular}{l l}
key & a string index into a dictionary \\
equational theorem & a theorem whose conclusion is an equation \\
implicative theorem & a theorem whose conclusion is an implication \\
bi-implicative theorem & a theorem whose conclusion is an bi-implication (formed by $¤$) \\
universally quantified theorem & a theorem whose conclusion is a $µ$-term \\
\end{tabular}
\section{CORRESPONDENCE TO THE SPECIFICATIONS}
As noted in the scope of this document, the material within it is specified within \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC003}, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC004} and \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC005}.
We must ensure two things with regard to these specifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item
That all the relevant functionality in the specifications is reflected in this document.
A function is relevant if the specification intends the
function to be available to ``a user''.
For instance, the function $mk\_thm$ is used in the specification, but is clearly not intended for the user.
We can ignore auxiliary functions in the specification whose only purpose is to
simplify the declaration of further functions.
\item
That no additional facilities are made available by this document that could be derived from the relevant specified functions.
\end{itemize}
As a step towards this we provide the following tables detailing
 the relationship between specified and design functions.
The items are presented in the same order as within \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC005}, and then in turn the relevant parts from
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC004} and \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC003}.
Then we give the material that is declared in this design with no corresponding item in the specifications.

The following lists items that are found in the design,
but have no corresponding specification.
A summary of the reason for their inclusion is given in each case:
``built-in'' items are given justifications in their
individual sections in this document.
A set of built-in inference rules are called for by \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD007}: the ones below were chosen by being demonstrated helpful by experiment.

\begin{tabular}{p{2.1in} | p{4.1in}} \hline
Item & Reason \\ \hline
$SEQ$ & a type abbreviation, introduced in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC001}, but this design uses a list of assumptions, instead of that document's function \\
$CONV$ & just a type abbreviation \\
$icl'suc\_conv$ & a built-in definitional schemata \\
$icl'string\_conv$ & a built-in definitional schemata \\

$icl'get\_theory\_name$ & a fast method of doing what is
already possible with $icl'get\-\_hierarchy$ \\
$get\_const\_type$ & a fast route of getting something
that could be extracted by $icl'get\-\_hierarchy$ \\
$get\_type\_arity$ & a fast route of getting something

$thm\_fail$ & a fast route of getting something that could be extracted by $dest\-\_thm$ \\
$string\_of\_thm$ & a fast route of getting something
that could be extracted by $dest\_thm$ \\
\end{tabular}

That we implement the types of theorem, theory, etc., internally as a single
abstract datatype is our strongest reason for presuming that
we have added no additional functionality - the only functions
that can manipulate the protected values must work ``through''
the functions and values provided by the abstract datatype,
and each is justified by reference to the specification.
Some of the types, e.g. $THEORY$, are presented to the user as labelled record types or other types whose contents may be extracted by pattern-matching - this does not 
reflect the internal forms which are abstract data types.
One particular kind of value that we have to be careful with is
the addresses of assignable variables. The implementation
uses such assignable variables in a number of places and we must
ensure that none become available to the user if assignment
to the addresses could cause inconsistency.
The only addresses used within that are visible outside of the abstract data type are to user data stores, which are judged to be 
non-critical values.

of the abstract data type.

type ÛCONVÝ;
=DESCRIBE
This is the type name conventionally used for conversions, that is, inference rules
whose last argument is a term, and whose result is an equation
whose LHS is precisely that term (no $\alpha$-conversion).
Though it would be type correct, we conventionally do not use this type name for other functions of type $\ldots\ ->\ TERM\ ->\ THM$.
=GFT Definition
type CONV = TERM -> THM;
=TEX
=ENDDOC
=TEX
\subsection{Types for User Data}
=DOC
datatype ÛUSER_DATUMÝ =
	ÛUD_TermÝ of TERM * (USER_DATUM list)
|	ÛUD_TypeÝ of TYPE * (USER_DATUM list)
|	ÛUD_StringÝ of string * (USER_DATUM list)
|	ÛUD_IntÝ of int * (USER_DATUM list);
=DESCRIBE
This provides a monomorphic type of trees whose nodes are labelled by terms, types,
strings or integers.
=USES
This type is used in the type $USER\_DATA$, and may be used elsewhere, as a means of storing data that may be represented in a ``reasonably general'' structure for ICL HOL related purposes, which also is
not polymorphic.
=ENDDOC
In some implementations we will wish to save objects of this type in files,
and thus we could not have objects of a monomorphic function type as a new kind of label (though encodings of them are possible).
=DOC
type ÛUSER_DATAÝ;
=DESCRIBE
This is the type of a store for objects of type $USER\_DATUM$.
It is implemented as:
=GFT ML
type USER_DATA = (USER_DATUM ref) S_DICT;
=TEX
=USES
Within the type $THEORY$ it is used to include such details as the fixity of types and 
constants.
=ENDDOC
By making this a dictionary of references the structure, as well as the garbage created by modifying the structure, is lessened.
On the other hand, it does allow 
the implementer to cause modifications
without checking whether the theory is locked, deleted, etc
(though they are strongly recommended not to, but to use the interfaces of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD012}).
\subsection{The Type of Theories}
=DOC
type ÛTHEORYÝ;
=DESCRIBE
A theory is a collection of type names, constants, and theorems,
plus some information about these things (such as fixity),
and a context of parent theories.

It is implemented as a labelled record type, as follows:

\begin{tabular}{|p{0.7in}|p{1.7in}|p{3.3in}|} \hline
Label & Type & Description \\ \hline
$name$ & $int$ & Internal representation of theory name. \\
$ty\_env$ & $\{arity:int,$ $level:int\}$ $S\_DICT$ & 
A dictionary indexed by type constructor names, returning arity, and definition level. \\
$con\_env$ & $\{ty:TYPE,$ $level:int\}$ $S\_DICT$ & A dictionary indexed by constant name, returning the type and definition level. \\
$parents$ & $int$ $list$ & Internal representations of names of parents of theory. \\
$del\_levels$ & $(int * int)$ $list$ &
A list of ranges of deleted definition levels - if empty then
no levels have been deleted. \\
$axiom\_$ $dict$ & $THM$ $S\_DICT$ &
A dictionary of axioms. \\
$defn\_dict$ & $THM$ $S\_DICT$ &
A dictionary of definitions. \\
$thm\_dict$ & $THM$ $S\_DICT$ &
A dictionary of theorems. \\
$current\_$ $level$ & $int$ & The current definition level. \\
$user\_data$ & $USER\_DATA$ $ref$ & The user data stored
in the theory. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

=ENDDOC
Users will start their HOL sessions within a current theory,
which perhaps possesses some parent theories.
They may then add to the theory by operations upon its contents,
or change the current theory by an operation upon theory attributes.
The user is recommended to use the access functions provided,
rather than manipulate this ``raw'' theory type.

The user will see each theory as named by a string.
Internally however this name is represented and manipulated 
as an integer (that is an index to the internal representation of
a theory hierarchy).
This internal representation of names is visible from various functions.

Similarly, a theory will contain a current definition level,
which is incremented by 1 at each definition, axiom, etc., saved in the
theory.
Various things, in particular theorems, are created and saved with a field
set to their current definition level.
This definition level mechanism is used to allow sound deletion of 
definitions and theorems.
These declaration levels will also be integers.
\subsection{The Type of Hierarchies}
=DOC
datatype ÛTHEORY_STATUSÝ =
	ÛTSNormalÝ | ÛTSLockedÝ | ÛTSAncestorÝ | ÛTSDeletedÝ;
=DESCRIBE
Objects of this datatype indicate the status of a theory within a hierarchy, being:

\begin{tabular}{| l | p{5.0in} |} \hline
Constructor & Description \\ \hline
TSNormal & Theory is present and may be written to. \\
TSLocked & Theory is present, and cannot be written to as it is locked. \\
TSAncestor & Theory is present, and cannot be written to as it is in an ancestor for some hierarchy. \\
TSDeleted & Theory has been deleted: the theory name may be reused for a new theory. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

=ENDDOC
It is possible that the list of statuses will be added to in
later releases, and thus this type should be used with caution.
=DOC
type ÛTHEORY_INFOÝ;
=DESCRIBE
This is a labelled record type containing certain information associated with a theory.

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{1.6in}|p{3.6in}|} \hline
Label & Type & Description \\ \hline
status & $THEORY\_STATUS$ & Current status of the theory. \\
inscope & $bool$ & True if the theory is currently in scope (i.e. can
its theorems, types and constants be usefully referred to). \\
contents & $THEORY$ & The theory contents. \\
children & $int$ $list$ & List of the immediate children of the theory. \\
name & $string$ & The name of the theory, as a string. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

=ENDDOC
This is not the type used internally, but is modified
to allow no access to addresses of dangerous assignable variables.
However, the user is recommended to use the access functions provided,
rather than manipulate this ``raw'' $THEORY\_INFO$.
\subsection{End of Kernel Types}
=SML
end; (* KernelTypes *)
=TEX
\section{THE ABSTRACT DATA TYPE $THM$}
=DOC
signature Ûicl'KernelÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
This provides the abstract data type $THM$.
It includes the
primitive and built-in inference rules,
and theory management material.
=FAILURE
6083	STATE RENDERED INCONSISTENT: state is now read-only, and
	you are advised to quit ICL HOL. Do not commit the ML database.
=FAILUREC
Error 6083 occurs when an interrupt has rendered the state of ICL HOL inconsistent.
This is an implementation issue, and is fully discussed
in the implementation document for the structure
associated with this signature.
=FAILURE
6036	?0 is from deleted theory ?1 (internally theory ?2)
6065	?0 not valid as it may depend on a deleted axiom or definition of theory ?1
6066	?0 was created in the context of theory ?1 which is not in scope
6072	The theory of ?0, ?1, is not in current hierarchy
=FAILUREC
The above errors are common to most of the inference rules of this document,
and some other functions within the signature.
All are raised by $error$ not $fail$.
Thus they will be raised with exceptions that name functions in this document, as conventionally exceptions raised by $error$ are not caught or processed by the ICL implementation.
=ENDDOC
The following are various kinds of well-formedness check failures - their exceptions are caught and handled by
interface functions, and so should never be seen by the user as raised by functions from this document.
A well-formedness check occurs on any types, terms and theorems saved in a theory.
=FAILURE
6013	?0 is ill-formed in current theory: type name ?1 is not declared
6014	?0 is ill-formed in current theory: type name ?1 does not have arity used
6015	?0 is ill-formed in current theory: constant name ?1 not declared
6038	?0 is ill-formed in current theory: constant name ?1 cannot have type used
=FAILUREC
The following are conceivable design errors, which
are common to many of the functions.
They arise where the implementation gives rise to tests
some of whose results are considered ``impossible'' - such
branches give design errors (which may in fact be, for instance, implementation errors).
As they should never be seen they are not part of the user documentation.
=FAILURE

=DOC
type Ûicl'HIERARCHYÝ;
=DESCRIBE
$icl'HIERARCHY$ is an abstract data type, which provides
communication between the functions $icl'new\_hierarchy$ and $icl'load\_hierarchy$ (q.v.).
Objects of this type should not become visible to the user.
=ENDDOC
A theory hierarchy is a collection of theories, together with
information about those theories.
In particular, it records whether theories are in scope, and whether
they may be modified.

Users will start their HOL sessions within a current theory hierarchy,
which perhaps possesses some parent hierarchies.

\subsection{Primitive Rules of Inference}
All the inference rules will check that the theorems they
are given are valid (i.e. do not belong to theories that are out
of scope, nor were they potentially derived from now deleted
definitions or axioms).
They will not check that their term arguments are well-formed, however,
as even if they are malformed, this cannot introduce logical inconsistencies.
Theorems saved in, or otherwise associated with changes in, a theory are checked for well-formedness however.

All of these inference rules will have corresponding
entries in the derived rules of inference, with names
formed by dropping the $icl'$.
These are the sole interface to the kernel's inference rules.
\subsubsection{icl'subst\_rule}
=GFT Signature
val Ûicl'subst_ruleÝ : (THM * TERM) list -> TERM -> THM -> THM;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
Substitution of equational theorems according to a template.

icl'subst_rule
÷
[‡1 ô t1=t1', ... , ‡n ô tn=tn']
‡ ô t[t1,...tn]
÷
‡1 À ... ‡n À ‡ ô t[t1',...tn']
=TEX
$icl'subst\_rule$ $[(thm_1, x_1),\ldots,(thm_n, x_n)]$ $template$ $thm$
returns a theorem in which $template$ determines where in $thm$ the $thm_i$ are substituted.
The $x_i$ must be variables.
The template is of the form $t[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, and wherever the $x_i$ occur free in $template$ their associated equational theorem, $thm_i$,
is substituted into $thm$.
The rule will rename as necessary to avoid variable capture,
in the same manner as $var\_subst$ (q.v).
The assumption list of the resulting theorem is the union of all
substitution theorems, regardless of use.

The conclusion of the resulting theorem will take its bound variable names
from $template$, not $thm$, as shown in the following example.
This provides an $\alpha$-conversion facility.

The function may be usefully partially evaluated with one or two arguments.

where the context must contain the stated definition of $µ$.
Then we can prove $µ\_intro$:

It is important to do all the generalisations before any  specialisations to gain the effect of instantiation in parallel.

\subsubsection{icl'freeze$\_$hierarchy}
=GFT Signature
val Ûicl'freeze_hierarchyÝ : unit -> unit;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
$icl'freeze\_hierarchy$ modifies the current hierarchy,
setting all undeleted theories in that hierarchy as an ancestor, and so read-only.
This resulting hierarchy is an ancestor hierarchy, appropriate for copying by $icl'new\_hierarchy$ (q.v.).
=TEX
\subsubsection{icl'new$\_$hierarchy}
=GFT Signature
val Ûicl'new_hierarchyÝ : unit -> icl'HIERARCHY;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
$icl'new\_hierarchy$ takes a copy of an ancestor hierarchy as produced by $icl'freeze\-\_hierarchy$(q.v.),
in which all undeleted theories in that hierarchy are marked as ancestors, and so read-only.
This new hierarchy may be later loaded by $icl'load\-\_hierarchy$ (q.v.).
=FAILURE
6090	Theory with internal number ?0 is neither an ancestor nor deleted
=TEX
\subsubsection{icl'load$\_$hierarchy}
=GFT Signature
val Ûicl'load_hierarchyÝ : icl'HIERARCHY -> unit;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
The current hierarchy is set to the stated hierarchy,
if that new hierarchy is a descendant of the current hierarchy.
A hierarchy is a descendant if it contains all the theories
in the current hierarchy, with the same name, contents and status,
though not necessarily same ``in scope'' or children.
The specification only requires the contents to be equal,
on the expectation that in such a case the rest cannot differ.
We put in further checks as an act of ``defensive programming''.
The current theory remains unchanged.
A hierarchy is formed by $icl'new\_hierarchy$ (q.v.).
=FAILURE
6033	Hierarchy is not a descendant of the current hierarchy

\subsubsection{icl'get$\_$hierarchy}

=TEX
\subsubsection{icl'seal$\_$hierarchy}
=GFT Signature
val Ûicl'seal_hierarchyÝ : unit -> unit;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
This command ``seals'' the current theory.
Once sealed, no theory may successfully be opened (i.e. have $icl'open\_theory$ applied to it) that does not have the sealed theory as a parent,
or is the sealed theory itself.
By the nature of the command a subsequent $icl'seal\_hierarchy$ can only be done on
a theory that takes the sealed theory as a parent,
or is the same theory,
because the current theory can no longer not satisfy this constraint.
A theory cannot be sealed if an undeleted theory in the theory database is neither an ancestor nor descendant.

This is similar to the effect of a $icl'new\_hierarchy$,
but with more precision and more effect.

Note that using this function in a child database will not
have an effect that persists over into a new session,
even if the child is commited (e.g. by $hol\_save$, q.v.).

\subsection{Operations on Theory Attributes}
In the specification, whenever a theory is modified a copy is made of the current hierarchy, that copy is modified,
and the copy is then made the current theory.
In our implementation we can sometimes shortcut this 
process, as our hierarchy is implemented as an array of addresses, so that we can modify theories ``in place'',
without taking a copy of the hierarchy.
The functionality doesn't change, merely the process achieving the effect.
\subsubsection{icl'open$\_$theory}
=GFT Signature
val Ûicl'open_theoryÝ : string -> (int list * int list);
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
This makes an existing theory of the current theory hierarchy the current theory,
making only it and those theories that are its ancestors in scope.
The function returns a pair of lists that are the internal form of theory names.
The first list is those theories that have passed out of scope,
the second is those that have come into scope.
=FAILURE
6017	Theory ?0 may not be opened (it is not a descendant of ?1 which must be in scope)
6035	Theory ?0 is not present in the current hierarchy
=TEX
Error 6017 arises from attempting to open a theory that doesn't have the last theory sealed by $icl'seal\_hierarchy$ as an ancestor.

Note that the Cambridge HOL $load\_theory$ would be implemented by
using $icl'open\_theory$ and $icl'lock\_theory$.
\subsubsection{icl'delete$\_$theory}
=GFT Signature
val Ûicl'delete_theoryÝ : string -> unit;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
If the named theory is present in the current hierarchy,
is not in scope (and in particular is not the current theory),
is writable, and has no child theories, then delete it.
This means that all theorems that were proven with the deleted 
theory as the current theory will become unusable.
In addition, the theory name will be ``not present''
(error 6035)
for all purposes, including allowing it to be reused for a
new theory.
=FAILURE
6035	Theory ?0 is not present in the current hierarchy

\subsubsection{icl'new$\_$theory}
=GFT Signature
val Ûicl'new_theoryÝ : string -> int;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
This adds a new, empty, theory to the current theory hierarchy,
with the given name.
The name must not previously have been used in the current hierarchy as a theory name, unless it has since been deleted.
The empty theory has no declarations within it,
but does have the current theory as its sole parent.
The function returns the internal form of the new theory's name.
The current theory does not change, unlike the user interface function $new\_theory$ (q.v). 
=FAILURE
6040	Theory ?0 is already present in current theory hierarchy
=TEX
The specification calls for a ``user data'' parameter: we instead always use a default ``empty'' user data value.
\subsubsection{icl'new$\_$parent}
=GFT Signature
val Ûicl'new_parentÝ : string -> int list;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
Adds the given parent theory to the list of parents of the current
theory, considered as a set.
It will fail if the parent theory does not exist,
is already a parent,
or if making it a parent causes clashes in the current theory
or its children.
This will bring the parent theory and its ancestors into scope.

The function returns the theories bought into scope.
=FAILURE
6035	Theory ?0 is not present in the current hierarchy
6037	Theory ?0 is locked
6071	Theory ?0 is a read-only ancestor

\subsubsection{icl'lock$\_$theory}
=GFT Signature
val Ûicl'lock_theoryÝ : string -> unit;

then it is made locked.
This locking may be unlocked using $icl'unlock\_theory$(q.v.).

=TEX
\subsubsection{icl'duplicate$\_$theory}
=GFT Signature
val Ûicl'duplicate_theoryÝ : string -> string -> int;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
$icl'duplicate\_theory$ $source$ $duplicate$ creates a new theory,
called $duplicate$
with identical contents and parents to $source$,
but without its children, a status of $TSNormal$, and it will not be initially in scope.
Note that unless $source$ contains no declarations, then neither
theory could be made an ancestor of the other, because of clashing
declarations.
The function returns the internal form of the new theory's name.
Note that the theorems (including axioms and definitions)
will have as their theory $source$, not the duplicate.
The sealed theory and its ancestors (see $icl'seal\_hierarchy$) may not be duplicated, as the result could 
not be opened.
Attempts to do this will give rise to errors 6026 and 6042.
Thus in particular theory ``min'' can never be duplicated, 
as it is the initial sealed theory.
=USES
To allow the user to modify and experiment with a theory that
has child theories that are not involved in the experiment,

val Ûicl'list_save_thmÝ : (string list * THM) -> THM;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
$icl'list\_save\_thm$ $(key list, thm)$ attempts to save $thm$ under the keys in $key$ $list$ 
in the current theory.
It will fail if $thm$ is not valid, the current theory is locked, there are no keys, or if any $key$ has already been used to save a theorem in
the current theory.
The function returns $thm$.

$icl'new\_spec$ & Deleting the specification (under all its keys), and the constants declared. \\
$icl'new\_type\_defn$ & Deleting the definition (under all its keys) and type declared. \\
\end{tabular}

Note that, amongst other effects, all theorems created in the theory since the deleted extension was created
will become unusable after the deletion.
However, $icl'delete\-\_extension$ will fail if it would cause a saved theorem to
become unusable: 
the user should first delete the theorem.

The function returns the level number deleted.
=FAILURE
6037	Theory ?0 is locked

There is no point in the function returning the deleted
definition, etc, because the theorem is unusable.

It is up to the interface to this package to determine what a 
user wants to delete, check that the deletions required are indeed desired, and do sufficient $icl'delete\_extension$s
to delete the original offending declaration.
This may be done by examining the results of $icl'get\_theory$.

It fails if the term is ill-formed (e.g. it uses an undeclared

the $icl'$ prefix from the above names.

\subsection{Theory Access Functions}
Many of the theory access functions are found only
in the interface document, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD012}.
The ones below are provided as they may be more efficiently
implemented within the abstract data type, than by
an interface function accessing the results of just
$icl'get\_theory\_hierarchy$.

\subsubsection{icl'get$\_$theory}
=GFT Signature
val Ûicl'get_theoryÝ : string -> THEORY;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
This returns the named theory in its ``raw'' state.
This cannot lead to logical inconsistencies,
e.g. by returning addresses of ``trusted'' ML variables that the user
could modify without going through the interface functions.
However, the user is recommended to use the interface functions,
rather than directly access the theory.

This function recognises ``-'' as indicating the current theory name.
=SEEALSO
$THEORY$ for the structure of the result
=FAILURE
6035	Theory ?0 is not present in the current hierarchy
=TEX
\subsubsection{icl'get$\_$current$\_$theory$\_$name}
=GFT Signature
val Ûicl'get_current_theory_nameÝ : unit -> int;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
Returns the current theory's name, in an internal form.
=TEX
\subsubsection{icl'get$\_$current$\_$theory$\_$status}
=GFT Signature
val Ûget_current_theory_statusÝ : unit -> THEORY_STATUS;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
Returns the current theory's status.
=TEX
\subsubsection{get$\_$const$\_$type}
=GFT Signature
val Ûget_const_typeÝ : string -> TYPE OPT;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
If a constant with the given name is in scope, then its type is returned, otherwise $Nil$.
=USES
This is also useful just as a rapid test for a constant being in scope.
=TEX
\subsubsection{get$\_$type$\_$arity}
=GFT Signature
val Ûget_type_arityÝ : string -> int OPT;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
If a type with the given name is in scope, then its arity is returned, otherwise $Nil$.
=USES
This is also useful just as a rapid test for a type being in scope.
=TEX
\subsubsection{valid$\_$thm}
=GFT Signature
val Ûvalid_thmÝ : THM -> bool;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
This function uses the check for the validity of theorems
that can give rise to errors 6036, 6065, 6066 and 6072,
returning false if such errors would be caused by processing
the theorem, and true otherwise.
=USES
To preempt errors caused by the primitive inference rules, et al.,
to allow the raising of more helpful error messages.
=TEX
\subsubsection{thm$\_$fail}
=GFT Signature
val Ûthm_failÝ : string -> int -> THM list -> 'a;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
$thm\_fail$ $area$ $msg$ $thml$ first creates a list of functions from $unit$ to $string$, providing displays of the list of theorems.
It then calls $fail$ with the $area$, $msg$ and this list of functions.
This allows theorems to be presented in error messages.
=TEX
\subsubsection{string$\_$of$\_$thm}
=GFT Signature
val Ûstring_of_thmÝ : THM -> string;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
This returns a display of a theorem in the form of a string,
with no inserted new lines, suitable for use with $diag\_string$ and $fail$.
=SEEALSO
$format\_thm$ is a formatted string display of a theorem.
=TEX
\subsubsection{Equalities}
=GFT Signature
val Û=|-Ý : THM * THM -> bool;
val Û~=|-Ý : THM * THM -> bool;
val Û=#Ý : SEQ * SEQ -> bool;
val Û~=#Ý : SEQ * SEQ -> bool;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
=INLINEFT
 =|-
=TEX
provides a strict equality test on the conclusion and assumptions of theorems,
=INLINEFT
~=|-
=TEX
provides an equality test on the conclusion and assumptions of theorems up to $Á$-convertibility and order of assumptions.
=INLINEFT
 =#
=TEX
provides a strict equality test on sequents,
=INLINEFT
~=#
=TEX
provides an equality test on the sequents up to $Á$-convertibility and order of assumptions.

=DESCRIBE
These theorem access functions are for ICL use only.
$icl'get\_theory$ and $icl'get\_current\_theory\_name$ are used to implement the functions named by dropping
the $icl'$ prefix from the above names.
The rest are made visible through the signature $KernelInterface$, are documented with that signature.

\section{TEST POLICY}
The functions in this document should be tested according to the general criteria described in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008}.
The partial evaluation of $icl'subst\_rule$ needs checking to ensure that it doesn't allow the encoding of a rule that doesn't check theorems in the scope it is used in.
