\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for the
abstract data type $THM$.
This includes its
primitive and built-in inference rules,
and its theory management material.
This is called for in section 4 of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD007}.
The high-level specification for the code is
given in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC003}, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC004} and \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC005}.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP006}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the
abstract data type $THM$.
This includes its
primitive and built-in inference rules,
and its theory management material.
None of the material, other than certain types, is for other than ICL use, and thus most description boxes merely state this.
This is indicated by using the $pp'$ prefix in the names.

The functions provided in this document allow the implementation
of a theory tools interface document \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD012},
and a derived inference rule document \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD007}.
Those two documents contain only non-critical code,
and should be the only direct use made of the material given a design
in this document.
This is because a design goal for this document has been to minimise the functions provided within the
abstract data type for theorems (which is critical code), while still providing enough
to allow the implementation of a fast set of interfaces
(non-critical code).
To this end we only note the signatures of the functions, and that the functions should not be used by other than ICL,
in documentation boxes, with signatures grouped by subsection.

We wish to reserve the potential for various forms of notification to occur by side effect whenever a theory is modified.
These notification mechanisms are to be provided outside of the
abstract data type $THM$.
Thus we prefix the names all functions that modify the theory database with $pp'$,
for all that in some cases initial implementations may set the user interface
functions just to equal the ones provided in this document.
We also give an $pp'$ prefix to any function we gather
profile information about, as the profiling is better done outside the Abstract Data Type.

A ``primitive'' inference rule is considered to be part of the logic,
whereas a built-in rule is one that, though it could be coded in terms
of the primitive rules, will actually be part of the abstract data type $THM$, and thus taken as holding true without being checked by using the primitive rules.

All functions require all their arguments before they can be evaluated,
unless otherwise noted.
This is in contrast to functions which may be ``partially evaluated'' with less than their full compliment of arguments.
For instance $pp'subst\_rule$ will check the well-formedness of its
list argument, and break apart the equational theorems within the list, even if not applied to the further two arguments
it requires to derive a theorem.
Thus it is said that we may partially evaluate $pp'subst\_rule$ with one argument.

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Loading this document is dependent on \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP003}.

This document is placing requirements on the properties of the
constants it invokes.
The following constants have their definition specified in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC003}:
$µ$, $¶$, $TypeDefn$ (as $Type\_Definition$).
$=$ and $´$ are given their properties by the primitive inference rules, rather than by definition.
$¤$ is later declared (in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP023})
as an alias for boolean equality, and thus all functions that handle equality will
properly handle terms and theorems containing $¤$.
Thus $¤$ is only used in this document when specific reference is intended to boolean equality.

The remaining constants: $Suc$, $Zero$, $Mod$, $Div$, $Cons$,
$Nil$, and $AbsChar$, are given their properties in
the declarations of theories $î$, $list$ and $char$.

\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
None known.
\subsubsection{Terminology}
The following supplements the terminology used in those documents
upon which this one depends.
\begin{tabular}{l l}
key & a string index into a dictionary \\
equational theorem & a theorem whose conclusion is an equation \\
implicative theorem & a theorem whose conclusion is an implication \\
bi-implicative theorem & a theorem whose conclusion is an bi-implication (formed by $¤$) \\
universally quantified theorem & a theorem whose conclusion is a $µ$-term \\
\end{tabular}
\section{CORRESPONDENCE TO THE SPECIFICATIONS}
As noted in the scope of this document, the material within it is specified within \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC003}, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC004} and \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC005}.
We must ensure two things with regard to these specifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item
That all the relevant functionality in the specifications is reflected in this document.
A function is relevant if the specification intends the
function to be available to ``a user''.
For instance, the function $mk\_thm$ is used in the specification, but is clearly not intended for the user.
We can ignore auxiliary functions in the specification whose only purpose is to
simplify the declaration of further functions.
\item
That no additional facilities are made available by this document that could be derived from the relevant specified functions.
\end{itemize}
As a step towards this we provide the following tables detailing
 the relationship between specified and design functions.
The items are presented in the same order as within \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC005}, and then in turn the relevant parts from
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC004} and \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC003}.
Then we give the material that is declared in this design with no corresponding item in the specifications.

\end{tabular}

The following lists items that are found in the design,
but have no corresponding specification.
A summary of the reason for their inclusion is given in each case:
``built-in'' items are given justifications in their
individual sections in this document.
A set of built-in inference rules are called for by \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD007}: the ones below were chosen by being demonstrated helpful by experiment.

\begin{tabular}{p{2.1in} | p{4.1in}} \hline
Item & Reason \\ \hline
$SEQ$ & a type abbreviation, introduced in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC001}, but this design uses a list of assumptions, instead of that document's function \\
$CONV$ & just a type abbreviation \\
$pp'suc\_conv$ & a built-in definitional schemata \\
$pp'string\_conv$ & a built-in definitional schemata \\
$pp'char\_conv$ & a built-in definitional schemata \\
$pp'eq\_sym\_rule$ & a built-in inference rule \\
$pp'list\_simple\_µ\_elim$ & a built-in inference rule \\

$pp'inst\_term\_rule$ & a built-in inference rule \\
$pp'plus\_conv$ & a built-in inference rule \\
$pp'seal\_hierarchy$ & a mechanism for ensuring that certain declarations will always be in scope, as discussed in section 2.2 of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC005} \\
$pp'get\_pervasive\-\_theory\_name$ & returns the name of the pervasive theory, set by $pp'seal\-\_hierarchy$ \\
$pp'get\_theory\_name$ & a fast method of doing what is
already possible with $pp'get\-\_hierarchy$ \\
$get\_const\_type$ & a fast route of getting something
that could be extracted by $pp'get\-\_hierarchy$ \\
$get\_type\_arity$ & a fast route of getting something
that could be extracted by $pp'get\-\_hierarchy$ \\
$thm\_fail$ & a fast route of getting something that could be extracted by $dest\-\_thm$ \\
$string\_of\_thm$ & a fast route of getting something
that could be extracted by $dest\_thm$ \\
\end{tabular}

That we implement the types of theorem, theory, etc., internally as a single
abstract datatype is our strongest reason for presuming that
we have added no additional functionality - the only functions
that can manipulate the protected values must work ``through''
the functions and values provided by the abstract datatype,
and each is justified by reference to the specification.
Some of the types, e.g. $THEORY$, are presented to the user as labelled record types or other types whose contents may be extracted by pattern-matching - this does not
reflect the internal forms which are abstract data types.
One particular kind of value that we have to be careful with is
the addresses of assignable variables. The implementation
uses such assignable variables in a number of places and we must
ensure that none become available to the user if assignment
to the addresses could cause inconsistency.
The only addresses used within that are visible outside of the abstract data type are to user data stores, which are judged to be
non-critical values.

type ÛCONVÝ;
=DESCRIBE
This is the type name conventionally used for conversions, that is, inference rules
whose last argument is a term, and whose result is an equation
whose LHS is precisely that term (no $\alpha$-conversion).
Though it would be type correct, we conventionally do not use this type name for other functions of type $\ldots\ ->\ TERM\ ->\ THM$.
=GFT Definition
type CONV = TERM -> THM;
=TEX
=ENDDOC

\subsection{Types for User Data}
=DOC
datatype ÛUSER_DATUMÝ =
	ÛUD_TermÝ of TERM * (USER_DATUM list)
|	ÛUD_TypeÝ of TYPE * (USER_DATUM list)
|	ÛUD_StringÝ of string * (USER_DATUM list)
|	ÛUD_IntÝ of int * (USER_DATUM list);
=DESCRIBE
This provides a monomorphic type of trees whose nodes are labelled by terms, types,
strings or integers.
=USES
This type is used in the type $USER\_DATA$, and may be used elsewhere, as a means of storing data that may be represented in a ``reasonably general'' structure for \Product{} related purposes, which also is
not polymorphic.
=ENDDOC
In some implementations we will wish to save objects of this type in files,
and thus we could not have objects of a monomorphic function type as a new kind of label (though encodings of them are possible).
=DOC
type ÛUSER_DATAÝ;
=DESCRIBE
This is the type of a store for objects of type $USER\_DATUM$.
It is implemented as:
=GFT ML
type USER_DATA = USER_DATUM S_DICT;
=TEX
=USES
Within the type $THEORY$ it is used to include such details as the fixity of types and
constants.
=ENDDOC
By making this a dictionary of references the structure, as well as the garbage created by modifying the structure, is lessened.
On the other hand, it does allow
the implementer to cause modifications
without checking whether the theory is locked, deleted, etc
(though they are strongly recommended not to, but to use the interfaces of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD012}).
\subsection{The Type of Theories}
=DOC
type ÛTHEORYÝ;
=DESCRIBE
A theory is a named collection of type names, constant names, axioms, definitions and theorems.
In the abstract data type of theorems, the ``names'' of theories are represented as integers.
For each type name the arity of the type is recorded and for each constant name
its type is recorded. In order to allow deletion of types, constants, axioms and definitions.
So-called level numbers are used to enables theorems that may depend on deleted
material to be identified and rejected.
In order for non-critical information such as operator fixity to be stored, a theory
also includes a user-data slot which may be used to encode such information.

A theory is represented as a labelled record type, as follows:

{\raggedright
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{2.65in}|} \hline
Label & Type & Description \\ \hline
$name$ & $int$ & Internal representation of theory name. \\
$ty\_env$ & $\{arity:int,$ $level:int\}$ $OE\_DICT$ &
A dictionary indexed by type constructor names, returning arity, and definition level. \\
$con\_env$ & $\{ty:TYPE,$ $level:int\}$ $OE\_DICT$ & A dictionary indexed by constant name, returning the type and definition level. \\
$parents$ & $int$ $list$ & Internal representations of names of parents of theory. \\
$del\_levels$ & $(int * int)$ $list$ &
A list of ranges of deleted definition levels --- if empty then
no levels have been deleted. \\
$axiom\_$ $dict$& $THM$ $OE\_DICT$ &
A dictionary of axioms. \\
$defn\_dict$ & $THM$ $OE\_DICT$ &
A dictionary of definitions. \\
$thm\_dict$ & $THM$ $OE\_DICT$ &
A dictionary of theorems. \\
$current\_$ $level$ & $int$ & The current definition level. \\
$user\_data$ & $USER\_DATA$ $ref$ & The user data stored
in the theory. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

} % end of \raggedright

=ENDDOC
Users will start their HOL sessions within a current theory,
which perhaps possesses some parent theories.
They may then add to the theory by operations upon its contents,
or change the current theory by an operation upon theory attributes.
The user is recommended to use the access functions provided,
rather than manipulate this ``raw'' theory type.

The user will see each theory as named by a string.
Internally however this name is represented and manipulated
as an integer (that is an index to the internal representation of
a theory hierarchy).
This internal representation of names is visible from various functions.

Similarly, a theory will contain a current definition level,
which is incremented by 1 at each definition, axiom, etc., saved in the
theory.
Various things, in particular theorems, are created and saved with a field
set to their current definition level.
This definition level mechanism is used to allow sound deletion of
definitions and theorems.
These declaration levels will also be integers.
\subsection{The Type of Hierarchies}
=DOC
datatype ÛTHEORY_STATUSÝ =
	ÛTSNormalÝ | ÛTSLockedÝ | ÛTSAncestorÝ | ÛTSDeletedÝ;
=DESCRIBE
Objects of this datatype indicate the status of a theory within a hierarchy, being:

\begin{tabular}{| l | p{5.0in} |} \hline
Constructor & Description \\ \hline
TSNormal & Theory is present and may be written to. \\
TSLocked & Theory is present, and cannot be written to as it is locked. \\
TSAncestor & Theory is present, and cannot be written to as it is in an ancestor for some hierarchy. \\
TSDeleted & Theory has been deleted: the theory name may be reused for a new theory. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

=ENDDOC
It is possible that the list of statuses will be added to in
later releases, and thus this type should be used with caution.
=DOC
type ÛTHEORY_INFOÝ;
=DESCRIBE
This is a labelled record type containing certain information associated with a theory.

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{1.6in}|p{3.6in}|} \hline
Label & Type & Description \\ \hline
status & $THEORY\_STATUS$ & Current status of the theory. \\
inscope & $bool$ & True if the theory is currently in scope (i.e. can
its theorems, types and constants be usefully referred to). \\
contents & $THEORY$ & The theory contents. \\
children & $int$ $list$ & List of the immediate children of the theory. \\
name & $string$ & The name of the theory, as a string. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

=ENDDOC
This is not the type used internally, but is modified
to allow no access to addresses of dangerous assignable variables.
However, the user is recommended to use the access functions provided,
rather than manipulate this ``raw'' $THEORY\_INFO$.

The above errors are common to most of the inference rules of this document,
and some other functions within the signature.
All are raised by $error$ not $fail$.
Thus they will be raised with exceptions that name functions in this document, as conventionally exceptions raised by $error$ are not caught or processed by the ICL implementation.
=ENDDOC
The following are various kinds of well-formedness check failures - their exceptions are caught and handled by
interface functions, and so should never be seen by the user as raised by functions from this document.
A well-formedness check occurs on any types, terms and theorems saved in a theory.

6013	?0 is ill-formed in current theory: type name ?1 is not declared

=FAILUREC
The following are conceivable design errors, which
are common to many of the functions.
They arise where the implementation gives rise to tests
some of whose results are considered ``impossible'' - such
branches give design errors (which may in fact be, for instance, implementation errors).
As they should never be seen they are not part of the user documentation.

$pp'HIERARCHY$ is an abstract data type, which provides

Objects of this type should not become visible to the user.
=ENDDOC
A theory hierarchy is a collection of theories, together with
information about those theories.
In particular, it records whether theories are in scope, and whether
they may be modified.

Users will start their HOL sessions within a current theory hierarchy,
which perhaps possesses some parent hierarchies.

\subsection{Primitive Rules of Inference}
All the inference rules will check that the theorems they
are given are valid (i.e. do not belong to theories that are out
of scope, nor were they potentially derived from now deleted
definitions or axioms).
They will not check that their term arguments are well-formed, however,
as even if they are malformed, this cannot introduce logical inconsistencies.
Theorems saved in, or otherwise associated with changes in, a theory are checked for well-formedness however.

All of these inference rules will have corresponding
entries in the derived rules of inference, with names
formed by dropping the $pp'$.
These are the sole interface to the kernel's inference rules.

=TEX
$pp'subst\_rule$ $[(thm_1, x_1),\ldots,(thm_n, x_n)]$ $template$ $thm$
returns a theorem in which $template$ determines where in $thm$ the $thm_i$ are substituted.
The $x_i$ must be variables.
The template is of the form $t[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, and wherever the $x_i$ occur free in $template$ their associated equational theorem, $thm_i$,
is substituted into $thm$.
The rule will rename as necessary to avoid variable capture,
in the same manner as $var\_subst$ (q.v).
The assumption list of the resulting theorem is the union of all
substitution theorems, regardless of use.

The conclusion of the resulting theorem will take its bound variable names
from $template$, not $thm$, as shown in the following example.
This provides an $\alpha$-conversion facility.

The function may be usefully partially evaluated with one or two arguments.

It is important to do all the generalisations before any  specialisations to gain the effect of instantiation in parallel.
Without this, if a variable to be instantiated is introduced by
a specialisation, and then generalised along with those already
present, then that variable occurrence will also be instantiated.

\subsection{Operations on Hierarchies}
The user will not see the effects of these

In particular, the user will find that they stay within one
hierarchy during what they see as a session.
\subsubsection{pp'freeze$\_$hierarchy}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'freeze_hierarchyÝ : unit -> unit;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
$pp'freeze\_hierarchy$ modifies the current hierarchy,
setting all undeleted theories in that hierarchy as an ancestor, and so read-only.
This resulting hierarchy is an ancestor hierarchy, appropriate for copying by $pp'new\_hierarchy$ (q.v.).
=TEX
\subsubsection{pp'new$\_$hierarchy}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'new_hierarchyÝ : unit -> pp'HIERARCHY;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
$pp'new\_hierarchy$ takes a copy of an ancestor hierarchy as produced by $pp'freeze\-\_hierarchy$(q.v.),
in which all undeleted theories in that hierarchy are marked as ancestors, and so read-only.
This new hierarchy may be later loaded by $pp'load\-\_hierarchy$ (q.v.).
=FAILURE
6090	Theory with internal number ?0 is neither an ancestor nor deleted

\subsubsection{pp'load$\_$hierarchy}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'load_hierarchyÝ : pp'HIERARCHY -> unit;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
The current hierarchy is set to the stated hierarchy,
if that new hierarchy is a descendant of the current hierarchy.
A hierarchy is a descendant if it contains all the theories
in the current hierarchy, with the same name, contents and status,
though not necessarily same ``in scope'' or children.
The specification only requires the contents to be equal,
on the expectation that in such a case the rest cannot differ.
We put in further checks as an act of ``defensive programming''.
The current theory remains unchanged.
A hierarchy is formed by $pp'new\_hierarchy$ (q.v.).
=FAILURE

\subsubsection{pp'get$\_$hierarchy}

=TEX
\subsubsection{pp'seal$\_$hierarchy}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'seal_hierarchyÝ : unit -> unit;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
This command ``seals'' the current hierarchy at the current theory.
Once sealed, no theory may successfully be opened (i.e. have $pp'open\_theory$ applied to it) that does not have the now pervasive theory as a parent,
or is the pervasive theory itself.
By the nature of the command a subsequent $pp'seal\_hierarchy$ can only be done on
a theory that takes the pervasive theory as a parent,
or is the same theory,
because the current theory can no longer not satisfy this constraint.
A theory cannot become pervasive if an undeleted theory in the theory database is neither an ancestor nor descendant.

This is similar to the effect of a $pp'new\_hierarchy$,
but with more precision and more effect.

Note that using this function in a child database will not
have an effect that persists over into a new session,
even if the child is commited (e.g. by $hol\_save$, q.v.).

\subsection{Operations on Theory Attributes}
In the specification, whenever a theory is modified a copy is made of the current hierarchy, that copy is modified,
and the copy is then made the current theory.
In our implementation we can sometimes shortcut this
process, as our hierarchy is implemented as an array of addresses, so that we can modify theories ``in place'',
without taking a copy of the hierarchy.
The functionality doesn't change, merely the process achieving the effect.
\subsubsection{pp'open$\_$theory}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'open_theoryÝ : int -> (int list * int list);
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
This makes an existing theory of the current theory hierarchy the current theory,
making only it and those theories that are its ancestors in scope.
The function returns a pair of lists that are the internal form of theory names.
The first list is those theories that have come into of scope,
the second is those that have passed out of scope.
=FAILURE
6017	Theory ?0 may not be opened (it is not a descendant of ?1 which must be in scope)
6043	There is no theory associated with internal name ?0
=TEX
Error 6017 arises from attempting to open a theory that doesn't have the last theory sealed by $pp'seal\_hierarchy$ as an ancestor.

Note that the Cambridge HOL $load\_theory$ would be implemented by
using $pp'open\_theory$ and $pp'lock\_theory$.
\subsubsection{pp'delete$\_$theory}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'delete_theoryÝ : int -> unit;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
If the named theory is present in the current hierarchy,
is not in scope (and in particular is not the current theory),
is writable, and has no child theories, then delete it.
This means that all theorems that were proven with the deleted
theory as the current theory will become unusable.
In addition, the theory name will be ``not present''
for all purposes, including allowing it to be reused for a
new theory.
=FAILURE
6043	There is no theory associated with internal name ?0
6037	Theory ?0 is locked

\subsubsection{pp'new$\_$theory}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'new_theoryÝ : string -> int;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
This adds a new, empty, theory to the current theory hierarchy,
with the given name.
The name must not previously have been used in the current hierarchy as a theory name, unless it has since been deleted.
The empty theory has no declarations within it,
but does have the current theory as its sole parent.
The function returns the internal form of the new theory's name.
The current theory does not change, unlike the user interface function $new\_theory$ (q.v).
=FAILURE
6040	Theory ?0 is already present in current theory hierarchy
=TEX
The specification calls for a ``user data'' parameter: we instead always use a default ``empty'' user data value.
\subsubsection{pp'new$\_$parent}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'new_parentÝ : int -> int list;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
Adds the given parent theory to the list of parents of the current
theory, considered as a set.
It will fail if the parent theory does not exist,
is already a parent,
or if making it a parent causes clashes in the current theory
or its children.
This will bring the parent theory and its ancestors into scope.

The function returns the theories bought into scope.
=FAILURE
6043	There is no theory associated with internal name ?0
6037	Theory ?0 is locked
6071	Theory ?0 is a read-only ancestor

\subsubsection{pp'lock$\_$theory}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'lock_theoryÝ : int -> unit;

If the named theory exists, and is currently writable,
then it is made locked.
This locking may be unlocked using $pp'unlock\_theory$(q.v.).

then this function unlocks it.

6068	Theory ?0 has not been locked
=TEX
\subsubsection{pp'duplicate$\_$theory}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'duplicate_theoryÝ : string -> string -> int;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
$pp'duplicate\_theory$ $source$ $duplicate$ creates a new theory,
called $duplicate$
with identical contents and parents to $source$,
but without its children, a status of $TSNormal$, and it will not be initially in scope.
Note that unless $source$ contains no declarations, then neither
theory could be made an ancestor of the other, because of clashing
declarations.
The function returns the internal form of the new theory's name.
Note that the theorems (including axioms and definitions)
will have as their theory $source$, not the duplicate.
The sealed theory and its ancestors (see $pp'seal\_hierarchy$) may not be duplicated, as the result could
not be opened.
Attempts to do this will give rise to errors 6026 and 6042.
Thus in particular theory ``min'' can never be duplicated,
as it is the initial sealed theory.
=USES

=TEX
=DESCRIBE
This returns the full representation of a theorem, in a safe, interface, form.
The level is the definition level at which the theorem was created, the theory is
that in which the theorem was created, and the sequent is the assumptions and conclusion
of the theorem.

$pp'list\_save\_thm$ $(key list, thm)$ attempts to save $thm$ under the keys in $key$ $list$
in the current theory.
It will fail if $thm$ is not valid, the current theory is locked, there are no keys, or if any $key$ has already been used to save a theorem in

$pp'new\_type\_defn$ & Deleting the definition (under all its keys) and type declared. \\
\end{tabular}

Note that, amongst other effects, all theorems created in the theory since the deleted extension was created
will become unusable after the deletion.
However, $pp'delete\-\_extension$ will fail if it would cause a saved theorem to
become unusable:
the user should first delete the theorem.

The function returns the level number deleted.

There is no point in the function returning the deleted
definition, etc, because the theorem is unusable.

It is up to the interface to this package to determine what a
user wants to delete, check that the deletions required are indeed desired, and do sufficient $pp'delete\_extension$s

This may be done by examining the results of $pp'get\_theory$.

\subsubsection{pp'new$\_$spec}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'new_specÝ : (string list * int * THM) -> THM;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
$pp'new\_spec$ $(keylist$, $ndef$, `$ô ¶ x_1,\ldots,x_n\ ·\ p[x_1,\ldots,x_n])$'
will introduce $ndef$ new constants named and typed from the $x_i$.
It will also save a defining theorem under each of the names in
$keylist$ in the current theory of the
form `$ô p[c_1,\ldots,c_n]$' where $c_i$ is the constant with the
name and type of $x_i$.
If either the constant or theorem introduction fails then
the function will not change the current theory.
Adding a new specification increments the level number of the current theory.
The set of type variables in the types of the $x_i$ must all be equal,
and the body of $p[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ must not contain type variables that are not in these sets.

The constants required cannot be ones that $mk\_const$ will refuse to form, thus error messages 3002, 3003 and 3004 below.

$ndef$ could be allowed to be $0$, which forms an odd way of
saving a theorem as a definition, though we do not currently allow this option.

We do not need Cambridge HOL's $flag\_name\_list$ parameter, which lists
the names of the new constants, and their lexical properties.
The names come from the existential quantifiers, the number from $ndef$, the properties
from separate user directives.

=DESCRIBE
These functions are the direct interfaces to the {\Product} logical kernel
and are used to implement the functions named by dropping the $pp'$ prefix from the above names.
Using these functions bypasses the extra services provided by the kernel interface module (such as
management of the symbol table) and is not recommended unless you fully understand the consequences.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Theory Access Functions}
Many of the theory access functions are found only
in the interface document, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD012}.
The ones below are provided as they may be more efficiently
implemented within the abstract data type, than by
an interface function accessing the results of just
$pp'get\_theory\_hierarchy$.

\subsubsection{pp'get$\_$theory}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'get_theoryÝ : int -> THEORY;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
This returns the named theory in its ``raw'' state.
This cannot lead to logical inconsistencies,
e.g. by returning addresses of ``trusted'' ML variables that the user
could modify without going through the interface functions.
However, the user is recommended to use the interface functions,
rather than directly access the theory.

=SEEALSO

=TEX
\subsubsection{pp'get$\_$current$\_$theory$\_$name}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'get_current_theory_nameÝ : unit -> int;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
Returns the current theory's name, in an internal form.
=TEX
\subsubsection{pp'get$\_$current$\_$theory$\_$status}
=GFT Signature
val Ûget_current_theory_statusÝ : unit -> THEORY_STATUS;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
Returns the current theory's status.
=TEX
\subsubsection{pp'get$\_$ancestors}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'get_ancestorsÝ : int -> int list;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
Given the internal names of a theory, this function returns the list of all ancestors of the theory (including itself).
=TEX
\subsubsection{pp'get$\_$descendants}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'get_descendantsÝ : int -> int list;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
Given the internal names of a theory, this function returns the list of all ancestors of the theory (not including itself).
=TEX
\subsubsection{pp'get$\_$const$\_$type}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'get_const_typeÝ : int -> string -> TYPE OPT;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
=INLINEFT
pp'get_const_type thyn conn
=TEX
\ returns the type associated with the constant with name $conn$ in the theory with internal name $thyn$ if any.
The function recognises numeric and string literals and returns the appropriate type.
=TEX
\subsubsection{pp'get$\_$type$\_$arity}
=GFT Signature
val Ûpp'get_type_arityÝ : string -> int OPT;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
=INLINEFT
pp'get_type_arity thyn tyn
=TEX
\ returns the arity associated with the type with name $tyn$ in the theory with internal name $thyn$ if any.
=TEX
\subsubsection{valid$\_$thm}
=GFT Signature
val Ûvalid_thmÝ : THM -> bool;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
This function uses the check for the validity of theorems
that can give rise to errors 6036, 6065, 6066 and 6072,
returning false if such errors would be caused by processing
the theorem, and true otherwise.
=USES
To preempt errors caused by the primitive inference rules, et al.,
to allow the raising of more helpful error messages.
=TEX
\subsubsection{thm$\_$fail}
=GFT Signature
val Ûthm_failÝ : string -> int -> THM list -> 'a;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
$thm\_fail$ $area$ $msg$ $thml$ first creates a list of functions from $unit$ to $string$, providing displays of the list of theorems.
It then calls $fail$ with the $area$, $msg$ and this list of functions.
This allows theorems to be presented in error messages.
=TEX
\subsubsection{string$\_$of$\_$thm}
For SML'97, $makestring$ which supported $string\_of\_thm$
is not available. We provide the following interface,
not intended for end user consumption to let us do without $makestring$.
Cf. the analogous treatment of terms and types in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD003}.
=SML
val Ûpp'string_of_thmÝ : THM -> string;
val Ûpp'set_string_of_thmÝ : (THM -> string) -> (THM -> string);
=TEX
=GFT Signature
val Ûstring_of_thmÝ : THM -> string;
=TEX
=DESCRIBE
This returns a display of a theorem in the form of a string,
with no inserted new lines, suitable for use with $diag\_string$ and $fail$.
=SEEALSO
$format\_thm$ is a formatted string display of a theorem.

\section{TEST POLICY}
The functions in this document should be tested according to the general criteria described in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008}.
The partial evaluation of $pp'subst\_rule$ needs checking to ensure that it doesn't allow the encoding of a rule that doesn't check theorems in the scope it is used in.

Non-error cases of $gen\_new\_spec$ will be tricky to test at this stage in the build other than in the special case where the input theorem has the form
=INLINEFT
x = t ô x = t
=TEX
. More complex cases will be covered where $new\_spec1$ is tested in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/MDT037}.
