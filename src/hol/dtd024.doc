\begin{description}

\item[31 May 1991, issue 1.1 ] This issue is an authors draft, it
	contains a first draft of the Oppen-style formatting routines.
	In this case the implementation of the routines simply formats
	the argument text without attempting to lay it out neatly.

\end{description}

	->	string list
=DESCRIBE
In the call `$oppen_format_as_string\;\;width\;\;printer\;\;arg$' the
string representation of the value of $arg$ is produced by the side
effects of function $printer$ which uses the Oppen-style printing
routines passed to it.  A complex value may be split across several
lines of text, one line per list element, the head element of the list
being the first line of the output.  The function $width$ returns the
maximum number of characters desired per line.  Longer lines may be
produced when an argument to the $addstring$ printing routine exceeds
the desired width.  The style of the interface is designed to be close
to that of function $PolyML.pretty_printer$ so that the same $printer$
function may be used for either.

In the call `$oppen_print\;\;width\;\;printer\;\;arg$' the
the value of $arg$ is printed on the standard output by the side
effects of function $printer$ which uses the Oppen-style printing
routines passed to it.  A complex value may be split across several
lines of text.  The function $width$ returns the
maximum number of characters desired per line.  Longer lines may be
