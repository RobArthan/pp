\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
Tools providing automatic existence proofs
are a supporting tools for the specification of constants
and are called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD010}.
This document provides a detailed design for these tools.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the
tools supporting automatic existence proofs.
These are required both to asist in constant specification (See $const\_spec$) and
as independent tools.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This document depends upon the paired-abstraction inference rules of
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD027}.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
The coverage of the material provided is uneven (e.g.
there is only ever one of a simple and paired form of a function).
This is the result of the functions being a toolbox to achieve
a particular goal.

$evaluate\_proof\_context$ duplicates the entry in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD026}, though the implementation is incomplete
in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP026}.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
None known.

\section{THE DESIGN}
\subsection{Components}
Some of the components that go to make up the main functions
are of interest in their own right.
They are presented here.
\subsubsection{Conversionals}
=DOC
val ÛALL_SIMPLE_µ_CÝ : CONV -> CONV;
val ÛALL_SIMPLE_¶_CÝ : CONV -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
These respectively apply their conversion argument to:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The body of a repeated simple universal quantification.
\item
The body of a repeated simple existential quantification.
\end{itemize}
=FAILUREC
\paragraph{Errors}
As the failure of the conversion argument.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val ÛALL_±_CÝ : CONV -> CONV;
val ÛALL_²_CÝ : CONV -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
These respectively apply their conversion argument to:
\begin{itemize}
\item
All the conjuncts of a structure of conjuncts (including a term that is not a conjunct at all)
failing only if the conversion fails for all the conjuncts.
\item
All the disjuncts of a structure of disjuncts (including a term that is not a disjunct at all)
failing only if the conversion fails for all the disjuncts.
\end{itemize}
The result is simplified at any conjunct 
or disjunct where at least one branch had a successful
application of the conversion and matches the appropriate theorems of:
=GFT
ô µ t· (T ± t ¤ t) ± (t ± T ¤ t) ± ³ (F ± t) ± ³ (t ± F) ± (t ± t ¤ t)

ô µ t· (T ² t) ± (t ² T) ± (F ² t ¤ t) ± (t ² F ¤ t) ± (t ² t ¤ t)
=TEX
=FAILUREC
\paragraph{Errors}
As the failure of the conversion argument.
=ENDDOC
\subsubsection{Conversions}
=DOC
val Ûsimple_¶_²_convÝ: CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This conversion will push simple existential quantifiers
into a term body that consists of nested disjunctions.
It will prove the input equal to a term formed by disjoining
the list of disjuncts, existentially quantified
by any of the original quantifiers that are free in that disjunct.

	(¶ z1 ... zo · P [z1 ... zo])
=TEX
where $\{y1...ym\}\ €\ \{x1 ... xn\}$, and
$\{z1...zo\}\ €\ \{x1 ... xn\}$.
The conversion will actually distribute over an arbitrary disjunctive
structure, though the result is ``flattened''.
=EXAMPLE

This function, and others, are designed to try, and fail in special cases,
rather than catch all problems.
Thus just in case we give error message 58015:

val Ûsimple_¶_±_convÝ: CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This conversion will push simple existential quantifiers
into a term body that consists of nested conjunctions
when not all the conjuncts have all of the quantified
variables free in them.
It will prove the input equal to a term formed by conjoining
the list of existentially quantified groupings
of conjuncts, grouped by possession of a quantified
variable free in each of the group.
It may not necessarily form the ``most pushed in'' form
with each conjunct minimally bound,
but will do some pushing in if any is available.

val Ûµ_±_convÝ: CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This conversion will push universal quantifiers
into a term body that consists of nested conjunctions.
It will prove the input equal to a term formed by conjoining

by any of the original quantifiers that are free in that conjunct.

where $\{y1...ym\}\ €\ \{x1 ... xn\}$, and

The conversion will actually distribute over an arbitrary conjunctive
structure, though the result is ``flattened''.
The conversion will work with paired universal quantifiers,
and will still return a result even if
it only acts as $all\-\_µ\-\_uncurry\-\_conv$ (q.v.), and does not
redistribute the quantifiers any further.

This conversion eliminates a simple existential quantifier that is equated to

existential.
The equation must also be ``reached'' only through 
existential and universal quantifications, $±$ and $²$.

\subsection {The Main Functions}
=DOC
val Ûprove_¶_convÝ : CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This is an automatic existence prover.
It uses its internal mechanisms, and material stored in the current proof context to attempt to prove a ``simpler'' term
equal to the conversion argument, which must be of the
form $¬¶ ...®$.
It will simplify by:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Converting paired existential quantifiers into simple ones (see $all\-\_¶\-\_uncurry\-\_conv$).
\item
Removing existential and universal quantifiers not used in the body of their
quantification.
\item
Distributing existential quantifiers over $±$ and $²$ as far
as it is able (see $simple\_¶\_±\_conv$ and $simple\_¶\_²\_conv$).
\item
Eliminating an existential quantifier that is equated to 
a term within the body of the quantification.
The term must not contain the existential quantifier,
nor may it have free variables that are bound in the
body of the existential quantifier, other than in an outer
existential.
Implicit equations (e.g. an implicit $¤\ T$ or by $³$) are also handled
(see $simple\_¶\-\_equation\-\_conv$).
\item
``Pulling out'' universal quantifiers through existential
quantifiers if the existential is a function applied in all its instances
to the universally quantified variables
(see $simple\_¶\_µ\_conv1$), or variable structures
formed by data constructors accessed by $get\_epc\_¶\_vs\_thm$ in the current proof context.
Redistribution of universals and data constructions may be done to allow this simplification to apply.
\item
Uncurrying existential quantifiers that are curried functions.
\item
Simplifying existential quantifiers that match the pattern of
use of recursive functions held by $get\_epc\_¶\_single\_dc$ in the current proof context.
\item
Traversing subterms reached from the outside of the term through (perhaps paired)
existential and universal quantifiers, and $±$ or $²$ operators.
\end{itemize}
It will repeat its simplification attempts until it can go no further.

\subsection{Proof Contexts}
=DOC
val Ûevaluate_¶_cd_thmÝ : THM ->
	(TERM list * int list * TYPE * (TERM list)list * THM);
=DESCRIBE
This gives the sophisticated user direct access to the internal mechanism
in $evaluate\_proof\_context$ for evaluating 
the input to $set\_pc\_¶\_cd\_thm$.
Its input theorem is of the ``standard'' form of a primitive recursion theorem or pattern matching theorem:
=GFT
µ fn1 fn2 ... ·
¶%down%1 f ·
(µ a11 ... · f (dc1[a11,...]) = fn1 (patt11[f,a11...]) (patt12[f,a11,...]) ...) ±
(µ a21 ... · f (dc2[a21,...]) = fn1 (patt21[f,a21...]) (patt22[f,a21,...]) ...) ±
...
=TEX
Compare this with:
=GFT
prim_rec_thm =
ô µ z s· ¶%down%1 f· (f 0 = z) ± (µ n· f (n + 1) = s (f n) n)  
=TEX
The $fn_i$ (in example - $z$ and $s$) are the new functions which express the behaviour
of each data constructor.
$f$ ($f$) is the function defined by clausal definitions.
The $a_{ij}$ ($n$ in the second conjunct) are the free variables of the data construction.
The $dc_i$ ($n+1$ and $0$) are data constructions, as in the example given these do not need to be the original data constructors of a type, just applications of constants and variables.
The $patt_{ij}$ ($f\ n$, $n$) are the arguments to the new functions. 
They may involve uses of the clausally defined function.

The result of this function is:
the list of data constructions,
a list of the number of free variables in each data construction,
the type of $f$,
a list of free variables in the data constructions,
and a theorem of the form:
=GFT
µ pred1 ... ·
(¶ f · (µ a11 ... · pred1 (dc1[...]) (patt1[...]) ..) ± ...) ¤
((µ x11 ... x1n · ¶ y1 · pred1 y11 x11 ...) ± ...) ²
(CombI(¶ f · (µ a11 ... · pred1 (dc1[...]) (patt1[...]) ..) ± ...))
=TEX
This is in a convenient form for proving the existence of
clausally defined functions, in particular
recursive functions within $prove\_¶\_conv$.
The $pred_i$, $x_{ij}$ and $y_i$ are generated by $gen\_vars$.

	list_prim_rec_thm,
	(rewrite_rule[ext_thm, o_def] sum_fns_thm)]
pair_pc)));
=TEX
and the evaluated form (via $evaluate\_proof\_context$ ``$prove\_¶\_epc$'')
based on this.
=ENDDOC
The following function needs implementing after the
methods of initialising all configurable proof tools have been introduced.
Thus it will probably migrate from this document in the future.
The need for this function is discussed in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD051}.
It is currently also declared in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD026},
but this version overwrites that one
(by adding parameterisation of the existence prover $prove\_¶\_conv$).
=DOC
val Ûevaluate_proof_contextÝ : string -> PROOF_CONTEXT -> EPROOF_CONTEXT;
=DESCRIBE
This function converts the user-presentation style of a 
proof context into one that may be set using $push\_proof\_context$ (q.v).
The string argument is the name of the resulting context.
