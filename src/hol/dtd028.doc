\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains the detailed design for the 
second group of tactics and tacticals for ICL HOL.
This group is mainly concerned with supplying support for predicate calculus
connectives (including boolean conditionals but not boolean $let$-expressions).
This is called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD009}.
The design is implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP028}.
\subsection{Introduction}
The second group of tactics and tacticals is mainly concerned with supplying support for predicate calculus
connectives (including boolean conditionals but not boolean $let$-expressions).
The main objective is to supply adequate goal, theorem
and assumption stripping tactics and tacticals (sufficiently
powerful to prove all tautologies). These and the other tactics defined
here may then be used to construct the rewriting tactics and
the elementary theory of pairs and so enable definition
of the tactics (and supporting rules)
which handle paired abstractions and other term constructs
which are not covered here.

This document contains first of all a general discussion of some of
the design issues and decisions concerning the tactics and tacticals
(section \ref{GENERALREMARKS}).
Section \ref{THETACTICSANDTACTICALS} then contains the specifications
of the tactics and tacticals, starting with the important tactics
which relate to stripping goals and theorems and then giving those
which relate to particular predicate calculus connectives.

Section \ref{CONVERSIONS} describes two conversions which are required
to implement the tactics and which also need some of the tactics for
their proof. As these conversions are likely to be required elsewhere they
are made visible here. Fortunately from the user's point of view they
are `simple' versions of conversions whose more general form will appear
in a more appropriate place.
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
Study material which relates to the coverage of the tactics and tacticals
may be found in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/WRK013} and
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/WRK014}.

The section of general remarks in the document describing the more
elementary tactics, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD009} also apply to this document.

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Loading this document is dependent on \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP009}.

\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
There is  currently no way of extending the stripping techniques more
generally than by adding extra conversions. If there is a requirement for
adding stripping techniques which do there own Skolemisation or assumption
(without going via an equivalent HOL existential quantifier, or one of the HOL
propositional connectives), then more general hooks into
$STRIP\_THM\_THEN$ and $STRIP\_GOAL\_THEN$ would need to be exposed.
Such hooks have been rejected for the time being since it is felt that they
would be rather hard to explain and because misuse of such hooks could
prevent $strip\_tac$ being an equivalence transformation.

\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
One could supply $strip\_tac$ etc. in versions with the
extra conversions as arguments. The present formulation, in which these
conversions are stored in assignable variables, has the advantage that
any application-specific conversions then permeate into all of the
tactics which introduce new assumptions via $strip\_asm\_tac$ (e.g.
$cases\_tac$). Versions of the stripping functions with the conversions
as explicit arguments could be supplied as well
if there was a requirement for them.

\section{GENERAL REMARKS}\label{GENERALREMARKS}
\subsection{Coverage}
We wish to supply tactics which correspond
to (a useful subset of) the inference rules for the predicate
calculus connectives given in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD007}. Here by
predicate calculus connective we mean one of the following:

Û
Ä, Å, ä, Ç, å, (if ... then ... else):BOOL, É, Ñ, T, F
Ê

It would be perfectly feasible to handle boolean $let$-expressions
as well. However, it is considered more appropriate to let the
user explicitly control the expansion of local definitions rather than
make the general purpose predicate calculus tactics expand them automatically
(and thereby run a risk of making the user's goal large and incomprehensible) 

In general, for each connective, $con$, (and also for some combinations of
connectives, e.g. $Ç\_T$), we supply:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
a tactical, $con\_T$, which takes one or more theorem tactic arguments,
and which may be used to attack a goal whose principal connective is
$con$ by inverting the introduction rule for $con$ to give one or more
subgoals. The theorem tactic arguments are then applied to any extra assumptions
in the antecedents of the rule, in an attempt to further simplify the goal.
E.g. $ä\_T\,thmtac$ is a tactic which works on a goal with conclusion of the
form $t1ät2$ by applying $thmtac(t1Öt1)$ to a goal with the same assumptions
and with conclusion $t2$;
\item
a theorem tactical, $con\_THEN$, which helps to use a theorem with $con$
as its principal connective by using the elimination rule for
$con$ to simplify the goal.
E.g. $Ñ\_THEN\,thmtac$ is a theorem tactic which uses a theorem
of the form $ÖÑxét$ by applying $thmtac(t Ö t)$ to the goal and composing
the resulting proof with the existential elimination rule;
\item
a tactic, $con\_tac$, which inverts the introduction rule for $con$ and
applies the standard stripping tactic to any extra assumptions in the antecedents
of the rule.
\end{enumerate}

In cases where there is more than one introduction rule (e.g. disjunction, for
which there are left and right rules), there will be corresponding $con\_tac$s
with suitably decorated names.
Every connective has a $con\_tac$, but
$con\_T$ and $con\_THEN$ are not always supplied. E.g. $con\_T$ is only
supplied for connectives for which the introduction rule eliminates some
assumptions (i.e. introduces assumptions when inverted), so, for instance, $É\_T$
is not needed.

N.B. $con\_tac$ or $con\_T$, may well not be the best or most
common way of handling a
goal whose principal connective is $con$. E.g. negation is usually best
handled by moving the negation inside other connectives when possible rather
than by attempting a proof inverting negation introduction (which latter amounts
to the variant of proof by contradiction in which one proves $Ö åa$ by demonstrating
that $a Ö b$ and $a Ö åb$ for some suitable choice of $b$).

It turns out in practice that $å$ and $F$ are some of the trickier
connectives to deal with and the tactics supplied to deal with them include
various tactics, mostly variations on the theme of proof by contradiction which
do not fit into the above scheme.

\subsection{Strengthening}
The phrase ``N.B. loses information.'' in a tactic description
indicates that the tactic strengthens the goal to be proved,
by losing some information that \underline{might} have been necessary
to complete the proof.
This is, of course, a common proof approach, but it is worth knowing when
such tactics have been used in case one generates an unprovable goal
--- which may indicate either that the main
goal is unprovable, or just that an incorrect choice of proof has been made.
All information-losing tactics will be noted.

\pagebreak
\subsection{Stripping Goals, Theorems and Assumptions}\label{StrippingGoalsTheoremsandAssumptions}
One of the most important purposes of the present design is to
supply the tacticals which are used to strip goals
and theorems. These tacticals support some common
techniques for proving goals or using theorems within
tactic proofs in a uniform fashion.
For example, a goal of the form $\{ˆ\}a Ä b$ is almost always
proved by reducing it to $\{ˆ\}a$ and $\{ˆ\}b$, and, dually, a theorem of
the form $Ö a Å b$ is almost always used to do a case split.

Very commonly the theorem stripping techniques are used to strip up theorems
corresponding to new assumptions introduced by a tactic. For example,
the obvious way of proving a goal of the form $\{ˆ\}(a Å b) ä c$
is to reduce it to two subgoals  $\{a, ˆ\}c$ and $\{b, ˆ\}c$. A uniform
means of performing this type of reduction is to have the tactic which strips
a goal of the form $\{ˆ\}t1 ä t2$ pass the theorem $t1 Ö t1$ to the theorem
stripper which then decomposes $t1 Ö t1$ into primitive constituents, performs any
relevant case splits and passes the primitive constituents on to a suitable
theorem tactic (typically $asm\_tac$). A more precise definition of
how this is done may be found in the following subsections.

The goal stripping techniques are packaged as a tactical
$STRIP\_GOAL\_T$ whose argument is a theorem tactic which
is used to process any new assumptions which may arise from stripping
the goal. The theorem stripping techniques are packaged as a thoerem
tactical $STRIP\_THM\_THEN$. The actual capabilities of
$STRIP\_GOAL\_T$ and $STRIP\_THM\_THEN$ are determined by assignable
variables containing lists of additional conversions to be attempted on a
given goal or a theorem if the techniques described below
do not apply. This allows application-specific transformations
to be handled in a uniform manner with the predicate calculus transformations
dealt with here. Note that any remarks below about termination of the
stripping process are made on the assumption that these conversions do not
lead to a loop.

The following subsections describe in outline the stripping facilities
supplied. This description is slightly simplified (as may be seen
by comparison with section \ref{THETACTICSANDTACTICALS}). For example,
it often turns out to be appropriate to supply a general theorem tactical
combinator, say $con\_THEN2$ which takes two arguments and obtain the more usual
$con\_THEN$ as a special case. The discussion below is not
concerned with such refinements.

\subsubsection{Stripping Goals}
Schematically, the effect on a goal of the goal stripping capabilities
supplied here is as follows:

Û
É_tac			({ˆ}, Éxét)			ã	({ˆ}, t)

Ä_tac 			({ˆ}, t1 Ä t2)			ã	({ˆ}, t1) ; ({ˆ}, t2)

Å_tac			({ˆ}, t1 Å åt2)		ã	({ˆ}, t2 ä t1)
Å_tac			({ˆ}, t1 Å t2)			ã	({ˆ}, åt1 ä t2)


ä_T ttac		({ˆ}, t1 ä t2)			ã	ttac(t1 Ö t1) ({ˆ}, t)

Ç_T ttac		({ˆ}, t1 Ç t2)			ã	ttac(t1 Ö t1) ({ˆ}, t2);
								ttac(t2 Ö t2) ({ˆ}, t1)

IF_T ttac		({ˆ}, if a then t1 else t2)	ã	ttac(a Ö a)({ˆ}, t1) ;
						 		ttac(åa Ö åa)({ˆ}, t2)

å_tac			({ˆ}, åt)			ã	({ˆ}, rhs(å_in_conv(åt)))

t_tac			({ˆ}, T)			ã	[]

goal_in_asms_tac	({ˆ, t}, t)			ã	[]
Ê
where $[]$ denotes an empty list of subgoals, i.e.that the tactic
proves the goal, 
and where $å\_in\_conv$ is a conversion which moves negations over the
other connectives, i.e. it proves theorems of the following forms
(and fails if none of them applies):

Û
	Ö	ååt		= t
	Ö	å(t1 Ä t2)	= åt1 Å åt2
	Ö	å(t1 Å t2)	= åt1 Ä åt2
	Ö	å(t1 ä t2)	= t1 Ä åt2
	Ö	å(t1 Ç t2)	= (t1 Ä åt2) Å (t2 Ä åt1)
	Ö	åÉxét		= Ñxéåt
	Ö	åÑxét		= Éxéåt
	Ö	åÑ∞xét		= Éxéå(t Ä Éx'ét[x'] ä x' = x)
	Ö	åT		= F
	Ö	åF		= T
Ê

Note that in the present document we do not deal with paired abstractions
so that $Ñ\_tac$ and $å\_tac$ are supplied as $simple\_Ñ\_tac$ and $simple\_å\_tac$.


$STRIP\_GOAL\_T\,ttac$ (as set up here) attempts to apply each of the
above tactics until it finds one which is appropriate.

Each of the above stripping tactics is an equivalence transformation
(in the sense that the original goal is valid iff. all of the subgoals indicated
are valid). If we also assume that the theorem tactic $ttac$ above always
either achieves its goal or produces a set of subgoals which is
logically equivalent to its goal and which has a possibly
increased stock of assumptions but the same conclusion, then we see that
iteration of these stripping tactics will always terminate
and result in a conclusion of one of the following forms (which we will
call {\em conclusion literals} in the discussion in this document, but
not in the descriptions for the user in section \ref{THETACTICSANDTACTICALS}
below):

Û
	Ñxét	Ñ∞xét	F	åa	a
Ê

where the principal connective of $a$ is not one of our predicate calculus
connectives.

Note that the treatment of disjunctions is asymmetrical. A utility
tactic $swap\_Å\_tac$ is supplied which allows the user to interchange
the operands of a disjunctive goal in circumstances where the choice
of simplifications made by $STRIP\_GOAL\_T$ is inappropriate.

\subsubsection{Stripping Theorems}

The theorem stripping capability supplied here may be shown schematically
as follows:
Û
Ä_THEN ttac (Ò Ö a Ä b)	({ˆ} t)		ã (ttac (Ò Ö a) THEN ttac (Ò Ö b)) ({ˆ} t)
Å_THEN ttac (Ò Ö a Å b)	({ˆ} t)		ã ttac (a Ö a) ({ˆ} t) ; ttac (b Ö b) ({ˆ} t)
ä_THEN ttac (Ò Ö a ä b)	({ˆ} t)		ã ttac (Ò Ö åa Å b) ({ˆ} t)
Ç_THEN ttac (Ò Ö a Ç b)	({ˆ} t)		ã (ttac (Ò Ö a ä b) THEN ttac (Ò Ö b ä a)) ({ˆ} t)
IF_THEN ttac (Ò Ö if a then b else c)
				({ˆ} t)		ã (ttac (Ò Ö a ä b) THEN ttac (Ò Ö åa ä c)) ({ˆ} t)
å_THEN ttac (Ò Ö åa)	({ˆ} t)		ã ttac (Ò Ö rhs(å_conv(åa))) ({ˆ} t)
Ñ_THEN ttac (Ò Ö Ñx.a)	({ˆ} t)		ã ttac (a[x`/x] Ö a[x'/x]) ({ˆ} t)
Ñ∞_THEN ttac (Ò Ö Ñ∞x.a)	({ˆ} t)		ã Ñ_THEN ttac (Ò Ö Ñx.a Ä Éyéa[y] ä y = x)({ˆ} t)
Ê

where $a[x'/x]$ denotes $a$ with $x'$ substituted for $x$, where $x'$ is a
variable which does not appear free anywhere in the theorem or the goal.

(The negation and existence theorem tacticals defined in this document are actually
$SIMPLE\_$ versions since we do not handle paired abstractions here.)

$STRIP\_THM\_THEN$ (as set up here) is a theorem tactical which uses
the first of the above theorem tacticals which applies to the
given theorem.

Each of the above theorem tacticals is an equivalence transformation
in the sense that if applications of the theorem tactic $ttac$ do not
lose any information then neither does its transform under the theorem
tactical. Morever if we repeatedly apply the above theorem tacticals
we will ultimately apply $ttac$ to theorems with conclusions having
one of the following forms (which we will call {\em assumption literals}
in the discussion below):

Û
	Éxét	T	F	åa	a
Ê
where the principal connective of $a$ is not one of our predicate
calculus connectives.

\subsubsection{Stripping Assumptions}

$strip\_asm\_tac$ is a theorem tactic which repeatedly applies
$STRIP\_THM\_THEN$ to a theorem tactic $check\_asm\_tac$ which
acts as follows:

Û
check_asm_tac (Ò Ö T) ({ˆ} t)		ã ({ˆ} t)
check_asm_tac (Ò Ö F) ({ˆ} t)		ã []
check_asm_tac (Ò Ö åa) ({ˆ, a} t)		ã []
check_asm_tac (Ò Ö a) ({ˆ, åa} t)		ã []
check_asm_tac (Ò Ö a) ({ˆ} t)			ã ({a, ˆ}, t)
Ê

where $[]$ denotes an empty list of subgoals, i.e. that the tactic proves
the goal. Note that $check\_asm\_tac$ does not lose information.

\subsubsection{$strip\_tac$}
The general purpose stripping tactic $strip\_tac$ is now
defined as $STRIP\_GOAL\_T\,strip\_asm\_tac$. From our observations
above on the goal and theorem stripping facilities this uses, we see that
repeated application of $strip\_tac$ reduces any goal to an equivalent collection
of subgoals each of which may be obtained from the original goal by (a)
replacing the conclusion by a conclusion literal and (b) adding zero or
more assumption literals to the assumptions.
Moreover, within each of the subgoals, each new assumption
will be distinct from any other assumption
and from the negation of any other assumption and from the conclusion.

As we will see in the next section the stripping tactic we offer the user
actually goes further then is needed to prove all tautologies (too far, in
fact --- it will not prove certain substitution instances of tautologies in which
a quantified subterm appears both positively and negatively).
However, it does not go to the extreme of putting the goal into a clausal form
(e.g. as might be represented by a collection of goals all of which had
$F$ as the conclusion and had assumptions comprising universally quantified
disjunctions of propositional literals).

The form of goal is considered to be a convenient
compromise between the two extremes, in that it simplifies
existentially quantified assumptions and universally quantified conclusions
without rendering the goal incomprehensible to the interactive user.
A resolution-style tactic could sensibly start from a goal in this form, either
by continuing to reduce to clausal form (for a fully automatic proof) or
by just doing some propositional calculus normalisations
inside the assumptions to 
allow derivation of obvious immediate consequences of the assumptions
in a form which is still comprehensible to the user.

\subsubsection{$taut\_tac$}
By using a subset of the stripping techniques discussed in the
previous sections, a tactic which will prove any goal whose
conclusion is a substitution instance
of a tautology may be produced. (Here we define a {\em tautology} to be 
a term formed from propositional variables and the propositional constants
$T$ and $F$ using the non-quantifying predicate calculus connectives, which
is true for any assignment of truth values to the propositional variables).

To see this, consider (without loss of generality) the case when the original goal
has no assumptions and observe that by applying only transformations
for the non-quantifying connectives we will reduce any goal to
an equivalent collection of subgoals in which each conclusion and each assumptions is
what we shall call  a {\em propositional literal}, i.e.
either a {\em propositonal atom} ---  a term which has a quantifier or a
non-predicate calculus connective as principal connective ---
or the negation of such a propositional atom.
Moreover, each subgoal, $\{ˆ\}t$ say is {\em (a)} such that no assumption
$a ù ˆ$ is $\alpha$-convertible with $t$ or with the negation of
any other assumption in that subgoal or with $T$, $F$, $åT$ or $åF$,
and  {\em (b)} such that $t$ is not $T$ or $åF$ or $åT$.

Now assume that the original goal had a tautology as its conclusion.
In this case, each subgoal produced by the stripping process of the previous paragraph
must be true with respect to any (consistent) assignment of truth values
to the non-constant propositional
atoms which appear (possibly negated) as its conclusion or in its assumptions.
I claim that no subgoal of the form discussed
in the previous paragraph can be true with respect to all such assignments.
For, there are two possibilities: either, (a), the
subgoal has the form $\{ˆ\}F$, in which case, as no assumption $a ù ˆ$
also appears negated in $ˆ$, we can choose an assignment which makes all the assumptions true and so make the subgoal false,
or, (b), the subgoal has the form $\{ˆ\}t$ or $\{ˆ\}åt$
where $t$ is not a propositional constant, but then, as no assumption is
$\alpha$-convertible with the conclusion $t$ or $åt$, we can choose
an assignment which makes each assumption true, makes the conclusion
false and so makes the subgoal false.
It follows that as the original goal had a tautology as its conclusion
then the stripping process of the previous paragraph must result in an
empty collection of subgoals, i.e. it will prove the original goal. 

(The above is a straightforward adaptation of a standard argument see, e.g. \cite{wang60}).

\subsection{Introduction of New Assumptions}
Many of the tactics $con\_tac$ (where $con$ stands for some predicate calculus
connective) naturally introduce additional assumptions. For example,
$ä\_tac$ might reduce $\{ˆ\} a ä b$ to $\{a, ˆ\} b$. However, in the
majority of cases it is best to strip up the new assumptions as described
in section \ref{StrippingGoalsTheoremsandAssumptions} before adding them
to the assumptions. Note that, in general, this may cause case splits.

For ease of use, therefore, those tactics, $con\_tac$, which
introduce new assumptions will always strip the assumptions. 
I.e. $con\_tac$ will be implemented as $con\_T\,strip\_asm\_tac$.
In the more specialised cases where stripping is not required the user may use
$con\_T\,asm\_tac$ to achieve the desired effect.

To describe such a tactic we use the notation $strip(\{a, ˆ\}t)$ to denote
$strip\_asm\_tac(a Ö a) (\{ˆ\}t)$.

val ‚strip_tac· : TACTIC;
=DESCRIBE
$strip\_tac$ is a general purpose tactic for simplifying away the outermost
connective or combination of a goal by applying the first applicable
member of the following collection of tactics:
Û
simple_É_tac	Ä_tac 		Å_tac		ä_T ttac,		Ç_T ttac
IF_T ttac,	simple_å_in_tac	t_tac		goal_in_asms_tac

If none of these tactics succeeds, $strip\_tac$ uses the conversions
held in the list maintained by $set\_strip\_goal\_convs$ and
$get\_strip\_goal\_convs$ to rewrite the outermost connective in the goal.

Any new assumptions generated by the tactic are processed using
$strip\_asm\_tac$. Thus $strip\_tac$ may produce several new
subgoals or may prove the goal. 

$strip\_tac$ will prove most
tautologies automatically. It will, however, 
not succeed in proving some tautologies involving positive and
negative instances of a quantified subterm.

val ‚strip_asm_tac· : THM -> TACTIC;
=DESCRIBE
$strip\_asm\_tac$ is a general purpose tactic for splitting a theorem up
into useful pieces using a range of
simplification techniques before using it to increase the stock of assumptions.
The simplification techniques applied will always include the
ones discussed below

Using $sat$ as an abbreviation for $strip\_asm\_tac$ we may show the
simplifications which do not involve negations or a case split
as follows:
Û
sat (Ö a Ä b) 			ã	sat (Ö a) THEN sat (Ö b)
sat (Ö a ä b)			ã	sat (Ö åa Å b)
sat (Ö a Ç b) 			ã	sat (Ö a ä b) THEN sat (Ö b ä a)
sat (Ö if a then b else c)	ã	sat (Ö a ä b) THEN sat (Ö åa ä c)
sat (Ñx.a)			ã	sat (Ö a[x`/x] Ö a[x'/x])
sat (Ñ∞x.a)			ã	sat (Ö Ñx.a Ä Éyéa[y] ä y = x))
Ê

Negations are handled by rewriting with the one of the following theorems.
Û
Ö	ååt		=	t
Ö	å(t1 Ä t2)	=	åt1 Å åt2
Ö	å(t1 Å t2)	=	åt1 Ä åt2
Ö	å(t1 ä t2)	=	t1 Ä åt2
Ö	å(t1 Ç t2)	=	(t1 Ä åt2) Å (t2 Ä åt1)
Ö	åÉxét		=	Ñxéåt
Ö	åÑxét		=	Éxéåt
Ö	åÑ∞xét		=	Éxéå(t Ä Éx'ét[x'] ä x' = x)
Ö	åT		=	F
Ö	åF		=	T
Ê

If the theorem has a disjunctive conclusion the action
of $strip\_asm\_tac$ may be shown schematically as follows:
Û
sat (Ö a Å b)({ˆ} t)		ã	sat (a Ö a) ({ˆ} t) ; sat (b Ö b) ({ˆ} t)
Ê

i.e. $strip\_asm\_tac$ does a case split resulting in two subgoals when
it processes a disjunction.

Finally, when none of the above transformations apply $strip\_asm\_tac$ attempts
to find an applicable conversion in the list maintained by
$set\_strip\_thm\_convs$ and $get\_strip\_thm\_convs$ and if that is successful
uses the conversion to rewrite the theorem before proceeding.


After all of the available simplification techniques have been attempted
$strip\_asm\_tac$ then proceeds as $check\_asm\_tac$ (q.v.) to use the simplified theorem
either to prove the goal or to generate additional assumptions.

the goal.
A tautology is taken to be any substitution
instance of a term which is formed from boolean variables,
the constants $T$ and $F$ and the following
connectives:
Û
Ä, Å, ä, Ç, å, if ... then ... else
Ê
