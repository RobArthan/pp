\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains th detailed design for the 
second group of tactics and tacticals for ICL HOL.
This group is mainly concerned with supplying support for predicate calculus
connectives (including boolean conditionals but not boolean let expressions).
This is called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD009}.
The design is implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP009}.
\subsection{Introduction}
The second group of tactics and tacticals is mainly concerned with supplying support for predicate calculus
connectives (including boolean conditionals but not boolean let expressions).
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
Study material which relates to the coverage of the tactics and tacticals
may be found in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/WRK013} and
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/WRK014}.

The section of general remarks in the document describing the more
elementarty tactics, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD009} also apply to this document.
The $ExtraSG$ convention mentioned in that document is followed here.

The phrase ``N.B. loses information.'' in a tactic description
indicates that the tactic strengthens the goal to be proven,
by losing some information that \underline{might} have been necessary
to complete the proof.
This is, of course, a standard proof approach, but it is worth knowing when
such tactics have been used to correctly interpret the state of
having reached an unprovable goal - does it indicate the main
goal unprovable, or just that an incorrect choice of proof has been made.
All information-losing tactics will be noted.
 
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Loading this document is dependent on \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP009}.

\subsection{Theorem Tactics and Theorem Tacticals}
Not sure about this section. The only ``theorem continuation'' KB supplied
was the following, which isn't a theorem tactic or theorem tactical!

$Š\_THEN\_T$ $thmtac$ takes the hypothesis of the subgoal's implication.
This provides a theorem that can be used as an argument to
$thmtac$.
This tactic is then applied to the current subgoal.
The hypothesis is then lost (apart from the use made by $thmtac$).

N.B. loses information.

$prim\_rewrite\_tac$ $\ldots$ is just $conv\_tac$ $(prim\_rewrite\_conv$ $\ldots)$,
with arguments the same as $prim\_rewrite\_conv$ (q.v.).
The remainder are the 
standard patterns of rewriting tactics,
all based upon $prim\_rewrite\_tac$.
They all use the canonicalisation rule $rewrite\_canon$(q.v.) to
process their theorems.

If a tactic is ``pure'' then there are no default rewrite theorems,
otherwise the rewriting theorems given by $set\_basic\_rewrites$
(q.v.) will be the default rewriting theorems, and any $\beta$ redexes will be reduced.

If a tactic is ``once'' then rewriting will proceed from the root
of the rewritten conclusion's theorem, towards the leaves,
and will not descend through any rewritten subterm.
If not, rewriting will continue, moving from the root to the leaves, repeating if any rewriting is successful, until there is no rewriting redex
anywhere within the rewritten conclusion.
This may cause non-terminating looping.

If a tactic is ``asm'' then the theorems rewritten with will include
the $asm\_rule$d assumption list of the subgoal being rewritten.

If a tactic is ``fasm'' then the theorems rewritten with will include
the $asm\_rule$d assumptions of the current subgoals assumption list which satisfy the predicate on terms supplied.

Any new assumptions introduced by rewriting with a theorem with assumptions different to
those of the subgoal will give rise to new subgoals, one per new assumption,
with the assumption list of the current subgoal.
