\subsection{Scope}

This document contains the module tests for the HOL pretty printer
for the ICL HOL system which are discussed
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD032}.  The tests use the module testing system
of~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD013} and~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP013}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{TEST HARNESS INITIALISATION}

\section{THE TESTS}

The tests for the
HOL pretty printing functions are within~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/MDT025}.
All we need to do is have a little look at {\em escape\_sml\_string}.


=SML
open HOLPrettyPrinter;
set_flag("use_extended_chars", true);
store_mt_results_show mt_run[
("mdt032.1.1", escape_sml_string, "\t", "\\t"),
("mdt032.1.2", escape_sml_string, " ", " "),
("mdt032.1.3", escape_sml_string, "ABCDEF\127", "ABCDEF\\127"),
("mdt032.1.4", escape_sml_string, "ABCDEFµ¶", "ABCDEFµ¶")
];
=TEX
=SML
set_flag("use_extended_chars", false);
store_mt_results_show mt_run[
("mdt032.2.1", escape_sml_string, "\t", "\\t"),
("mdt032.2.2", escape_sml_string, " ", " "),
("mdt032.2.3", escape_sml_string, "ABCDEF\127", "ABCDEF\\127"),
("mdt032.2.4", escape_sml_string, "ABCDEFµ¶", "ABCDEF\\181\\182")
