\subsection{Scope}

This document contains the module tests for the HOL pretty printer
for the ICL HOL system which are discussed
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD032}.  The tests use the module testing system
of~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD013} and~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP013}.

HOL pretty printing functions are within~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/MDT025}.
