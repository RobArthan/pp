\subsection{Changes Forecast}
\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains the module testing of the Subgoal Package, required by \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD030}.
The design is in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD030}
and it is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP030}.

\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains the module testing of the material given a design in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD030},
following the test policy given in that document and the general policy given in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008}.

Much of the testing uses material from \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD013},
though this is incapable of testing that the information outputs of the subgoal package are correct.
In addition, it sometimes only tests that the results are as expected by subsequent testing of the subgoal package state,
rather than the immediate outputs of the function tested.

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This document is derived from the detailed design in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD030},
and is further influenced by the implementation, in  \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP030}.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.
\section{TEST CASES}
We test each function of the signature of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD003}
in turn, where possible in the same order as in the design document.

\section{INITIALISATION}
Get a new theory to work in:
=SML
val start_theory = get_current_theory_name();
(open_theory "basic_hol" handle _ => ());
(set_pc "basic_hol" handle _ => ());
repeat drop_main_goal;
new_theory "test_mdt030";
=TEX
Initialise the test package:
=SML
use_file "dtd013.sml";
use_file "imp013.sml";
init_mt_results();
=TEX
=SML
fun list_eq (eq:'a * 'a -> bool) ((a :: x), (b :: y)) : bool = (
	eq(a,b) andalso list_eq eq (x, y)
) | list_eq eq ([], []) = true
| list_eq _ _ = false;
=TEX
=SML
infix 3 =*#;
fun (a,b) =*# (c,d) = (a = c) andalso (b =# d);

val goal9 : GOAL = ([],¬a1 ± a2 ± a3 ± a4 ± a5 ± a6 ± a7 ± a8 ± a9 ± a10 ± a11 ± a12 ± a13 ± a14 ± a15®);

\section{THE TESTS}
\subsection{push\_goal}
We test the correct operation by checking that the
top main goal, top current goal, and goal labelled ``'' are
the goal pushed.
We cannot test message 30001, except by examination of output.
=SML
push_goal goal3;
push_goal goal1;

	("push_goal 1 a",
	top_main_goal,
	(),

	("push_goal 1 b",
	top_goal,
	(),
	goal1)
	];
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[
	("push_goal 1 c",
	top_labelled_goal,
	"",
	goal1)
	];
=TEX
=SML
push_goal goal2;
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[
	("push_goal 2 a",
	top_main_goal,

	("push_goal 2 b",
	top_goal,
	(),
	goal2)
	];
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[

	];
=TEX
=SML
store_mt_results mt_run_fail [

	("push_goal 30004 b",
	push_goal,
	([¬µ x · x®, ¬µ y ·y®],¬T®),
	gen_fail_msg "push_goal" 30004 ["¬µ x· x®", "¬µ y· y®"])
	];
=TEX
Now check that the stacking is doing what its meant to.
=SML
drop_main_goal();
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[
	("push_goal 3",
	top_main_goal,
	(),
	goal1)];
=TEX
\subsection{set\_goal}
We test the correct operation by checking that the
top main goal, top current goal, and goal labelled ``'' are
the goal pushed.
We cannot test message 30001, except by examination of output.
=SML
empty_subgoal_state ();
push_goal goal3;
push_goal goal0;
set_goal goal1;
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[
	("set_goal 1 a",
	top_main_goal,
	(),
	goal1),
	("set_goal 1 b",
	top_goal,
	(),
	goal1)
	];
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[
	("set_goal 1 c",
	top_labelled_goal,
	"",
	goal1)
	];
=TEX
=SML
set_goal goal2;
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[
	("set_goal 2 a",
	top_main_goal,
	(),
	goal2),
	("set_goal 2 b",
	top_goal,
	(),
	goal2)
	];
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[
	("set_goal 2 c",
	top_labelled_goal,
	"",
	goal2)
	];
=TEX
Now check that the stacking is doing what its meant to.
=SML
drop_main_goal();
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[
	("set_goal 3",
	top_main_goal,
	(),
	goal3)];
=TEX
=SML
store_mt_results mt_run_fail [
	("set_goal 30002",
	set_goal,
	([],¬1®),
	gen_fail_msg "set_goal" 30002 ["¬1®"]),
	("set_goal 30003",
	set_goal,
	([¬T®, ¬1®, ¬F®],¬T®),
	gen_fail_msg "set_goal" 30003 ["¬1®"]),
	("set_goal 30004 a",
	set_goal,
	([¬T®, ¬T®],¬T®),
	gen_fail_msg "set_goal" 30004 ["¬T®", "¬T®"]),
	("set_goal 30004 b",
	set_goal,
	([¬µ x · x®, ¬µ y ·y®],¬T®),
	gen_fail_msg "set_goal" 30004 ["¬µ x· x®", "¬µ y· y®"])
	];
=TEX
\subsection{push\_goal\_state\_thm}
First get a goal state theorem to test:
=SML
push_goal goal2;
a ±_tac;
val gst_thm = top_goal_state_thm ();
=TEX
Now try using it:
=SML
push_goal_state_thm gst_thm;
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[
	("push_goal_state_thm a",
	top_main_goal,
	(),
	goal2),
	("push_goal_state_thm b",
	top_goal,
	(),
	sg1_goal2)
	];
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[
	("push_goal_state_thm c",
	top_labelled_goal,
	"1",
	sg1_goal2),
	("push_goal_state_thm d",
	top_labelled_goal,
	"2",
	sg2_goal2)
	];
=TEX
=SML
store_mt_results mt_run_fail [
	("push_goal_state_thm 30005 a",
	push_goal_state_thm,
	t_thm,
	gen_fail_msg "push_goal_state_thm" 30005 ["ô T"]),
	("push_goal_state_thm 30005 b",
	push_goal_state_thm,
	asm_intro mk_t gst_thm,
	gen_fail_msg "push_goal_state_thm" 30005 [
	"µ p q r· p ± q ´ r ± (µ s· s) ´ pp'TS p, "^
    "µ p q r s· p ± q ´ r ± (µ s· s) ´ pp'TS (s ± (µ q· q = 0)), T "^
  "ô µ p q r s· p ± q ´ r ± (µ s· s) ´ pp'TS (p ± s ± (µ q· q = 0))"])
	];
=TEX
\subsection{a(pply\_tactic)}
We need to test for the labelling if none, one or many subgoals are produced,
as well as the various special cases (duplicates, etc).
Note that $a$ is the alias for $apply\_tactic$.

No subgoals:
=SML
push_goal goal4;
a ±_tac;
a strip_tac;
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[
	("apply_tactic 1",
	top_goal,
	(),
	sg2_goal4)
	];
=TEX
One subgoal:
=SML
push_goal goal3;
a strip_tac;
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[
	("apply_tactic 2",
	top_labelled_goal,
	"",
	sg_goal3)
	];
=TEX
Many subgoals:
=SML
push_goal goal2;
a ±_tac;
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[
	("apply_tactic 3",
	top_goal,
	(),
	sg1_goal2)
	];
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[
	("apply_tactic 4",
	top_labelled_goal,
	"1",
	sg1_goal2),
	("apply_tactic 5",
	top_labelled_goal,
	"2",
	sg2_goal2)
	];
=TEX
The following checks that distinct free variables with the same names in a pushed goal
causes a suitable failure.
Earlier versions of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP030} would fail unhelpfully when apply tactics to such goals.
=SML
store_mt_results mt_run_fail [(
	"push_goal 30058",
	push_goal,
	goal7,
	gen_fail_msg "push_goal" 30058 ["a"])];
store_mt_results mt_run_fail [(
	("push_goal_state_thm 30058",
	push_goal_state_thm,
	gst1,
	gen_fail_msg "push_goal_state_thm" 30058 ["a"]))];
=TEX
A similar thing occurring in later subgoals is tested by:
=SML
val was_flag = set_flag("subgoal_package_ti_context",false);
push_goal goal8;
a (simple_¶_tac ¬a:BOOL®);
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[(
	"apply_tac 6",
	top_labelled_goal,
	"",
	([¬(a : '1) = a®],¬(a : BOOL) = a®))];
a id_tac;
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[(
	"apply_tac 7",
	top_labelled_goal,
	"",
	([¬(a : '1) = a®],¬(a : BOOL) = a®))];
a (REPEAT strip_tac);
store_mt_results (mt_runf (op =#))[(
	"apply_tac 8",
	dest_thm o top_thm,
	(),
	goal8)];
set_flag("subgoal_package_ti_context",was_flag);
=TEX
Test warning 30018:
=SML
set_int_control ("tactic_subgoal_warning",13);
push_goal goal9;
store_mt_results mt_run_fail [(
	"tactic_subgoal_warning 30018",
	apply_tactic,
	REPEAT strip_tac,
	gen_fail_msg "apply_tactic"  30018 ["15"])];
drop_main_goal();
=TEX
The following manifest various information messages,
whose presence must be visually checked for.

\subsection{Miscellaneous Goal-Printing Tests}
The following ensures that the goal printing is using the
right translations.
Unfortunately, the effect can only be checked by inspecting
the output of the tests, where the goals should be displayed in
the obvious form.
Version 1.13 and before of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP030}
would give a corrupted output involving many more ``Q''s than input.
=SML
push_goal([¬Q = QQ®],¬µ Q QQ QQQ QQQQ x · (x = Q) ² (x = QQ) ²
	(x = QQQ) ² (x = QQQQ)®);
=TEX
The following tests the handling of line length:
=SML
val lgoal = ([¬f1 ± f2 ± f3 ± f4 ± f5 ± f6 ± f7 ± f8 ± f9 ±
	f10 ± f11 ± f12 ± f13 ± f14 ± f15 ± f16 ± f17 ± f 18®,
	¬f19 ± f20®],
	¬f1 ² f2 ² f3 ² f4 ² f5 ² f6 ² f7 ² f8 ² f9 ² f10 ²
	 f11 ² f12 ² f13 ² f14 ² f15 ² f16 ² f17 ² f 18 ² f19 ² f20®);
val lline_length = set_line_length 60;
push_goal lgoal;
val dummy = set_line_length 40;
push_goal lgoal;
val dummy = set_line_length 20;
push_goal lgoal;
val lline_length = set_line_length lline_length;
=TEX
Notice that line length 20 is not properly handled - the actual
length is more like 30.
