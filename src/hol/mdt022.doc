\subsection{Scope}

This document contains the module tests for the HOL parser
interface
for the ICL HOL system which are discussed
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD022}.  The tests use the module testing system
of~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD013} and~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP013}.

\section{THE TESTS}

The tests in this document test the interfaces
$HOL\_term\_recogniser$ and $HOL\_type\_recogniser$
via the reader-writer \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD005}. The results
are compared with the term as output by the pretty printer
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD032}. The tests assume the presence and
correctness of the reader-writer and the pretty printer.
