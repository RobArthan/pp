\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for the
third grouping of tactics, in particular those concerning paired abstractions.
This is called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD012}.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP029}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the
third grouping of tactics, in particular those concerning paired abstractions.

The document provides groups of tactics, related by their core operator.

All functions require all their arguments to begin evaluation,
unless otherwise noted.

Note also that the order of declaration given in this document will
not necessarily reflect the order of implementation in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP029}.

We use the notation ``varstruct'' for ``an allowed variable structure, under ICL HOL syntax''.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Loading this document is dependent on \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP026}.
It is implemented in theory ``pair''.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
None known.
\section{INFIX DIRECTIVES}
A Standard ML $infix$ directive must be given at the ``top level''.
Thus we give the directives here for those functions declared in the following signatures.
=SML
infix 4 THEN_T1;
infix 4 THEN1;
=TEX

\section{THE SIGNATURE}
=DOC
signature €Tactics3› = sig
=DESCRIBE
This provides a third group of tactics.
They are primarily concerned with adding handling for paired abstractions.

\section{TACTICS}
\subsection{Concerning Tautologies}
The following are all implemented using $simple\_taut\_tac$.
=DOC
val €taut_tac› : TACTIC;

A tautology prover.
If the conclusion of the goal is a tautology then $taut\_tac$ will prove
the goal.
A tautology is taken to be any (perhaps universally quantified) substitution
instance of a term which is formed from boolean variables,
the constants $T$ and $F$ and the following
connectives:
=GFT
±, ≤, ¥, §, ≥, if ... then ... else

and which is true for any assignment of truth values to the variables.
If its argument is a tautologically true term, then the
function will return a theorem that the term is equivalent to $T$.

\subsection{Concerning ¥ and §}
=DOC
val €¥_thm_tac› : THM -> TACTIC;

A tactic which uses a theorem whose conclusion is an
implication, $t1 ¥ t2$, to reduce a goal with conclusion $t2$
to $t1$.
=FRULE 2 Tactic

=DESCRIBE
=INLINEFT
back_chain_thm_tac
=TEX
\ is a tactic which uses a theorem whose conclusion is a possibly
universally quantified implication or bi-implication to chain backwards
one step from the conclusion of a goal. (%
=INLINEFT
bc_thm_tac
=TEX
\ is an alias for
=INLINEFT
back_chain_thm_tac
=TEX
.)
The effect is as follows:

=FRULE 2 Tactic
bc_thm_tac
á1 Ù t1 ¥ t2
˜
{ á } t2'
˜
{ á } t1'
=TEX
=FRULE 2 Tactic
bc_thm_tac
á1 Ù t1 § t2
˜
{ á } t2'
˜
{ á } t1'
=TEX
where $t2'$ is an instance (under type instantiation and substitution)
of $t2$ and $t1'$ is the corresponding instance of $t1$.
If $t1'$ contains free variables which do not appear in
the assumptions of the instantiated theorem or in $t2'$, then the new subgoal
$t1'$ will be existentially quantified over these variables.
For example,
=TEX
=FRULE 2 Example
bc_thm_tac
Ù µ m i n∑ m < i ± i < n ¥ m < n
˜
{ á } a < b
˜
{ á } ∂ i∑ a < i ± i < b
=TEX

Note that, bi-implications are in effect treated as right-to-left rewrite
rules at the top level by this tactic. The standard rewriting
mechanisms may be used for left-to-right rewriting.

N.B. this tactic strengthens the goal, i.e. it may result in unprovable
subgoals even when the original goal was provable.

=DESCRIBE
=INLINEFT
back_chain_tac
=TEX
\ is a tactic which uses theorems whose conclusions are possibly
universally quantified implications or bi-implications, to reason
backwards from the conclusion of a goal.
(%
=INLINEFT
bc_tac
=TEX
\ is an alias for
=INLINEFT
back_chain_tac
=TEX
.) The tactic
repeatedly performs the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Scan the list of theorems looking for an implication,
=INLINEFT
t1 ¥ t2
=TEX
, or a bi-implication
=INLINEFT
t1 § t2
=TEX
\ for which the conclusion of the goal is a substitution instance, $t2'$
say, of $t2$. If no such theorem is found then stop.
\item
If in step 1, an applicable theorem, say $thm$, has been found reduce the goal to
the corresponding instance of $t1$ (or an existentially quantified version
thereof) using
=INLINEFT
bc_thm_tac
=TEX
, q.v.
\item
Repeatedly apply
=INLINEFT
µ_tac
=TEX
\ or
=INLINEFT
±_tac
=TEX
\ until neither of these is applicable.
\item
Delete $thm$ from the list of theorems and return to step 1.
\end{enumerate}

In step 4, only the first appearance of $thm$ is removed from the list,
so that one can arrange for a theorem to be used more than once by the
tactic by putting several copies of it in the list.

For example:
=FRULE 2 Example
¥_tac
[á1 Ù t1 ± (µx∑t2) ¥ t3,
á2 Ù t4 § t1,
á3 Ù t5 ¥ t2,
˜
{ á } t3'
˜
{ á } t4'; { á } t5'
=TEX

(Here $t3'$ is some substitution instance of $t3$ and $t4'$ and $t5'$ are the
corresponding instances of $t4$ and $t5$.)

N.B. this tactic strengthens the goal, i.e. it may result in unprovable
subgoals even when the original goal was provable.
=SEEALSO
$bc\_thm\_tac$ (which is used to perform step 2).
=FAILURE
29012	Theorem ?0 is not of the form `á Ù µ x1 ... xn ∑ u § v`
	or `á Ù µ x1 ... xn ∑ u ¥ v`
=ENDDOC
The above formulation of backwards chaining has been explicitly designed for
the case when a theorem is being assembled from several lemmas proved
separately and is not intended to be a precise dual of the forward chaining
tactics. Backward chaining using the assumptions will work but a separate
tactic with a dedicated canonicalisation of both assumptions and the
conclusion would be needed to provide such a dual (and it is unclear
what the right canonicalisation would be).
=DOC
val €forward_chain_tac› : THM list -> TACTIC;
val €fc_tac› : THM list -> TACTIC;
val €all_forward_chain_tac› : THM list -> TACTIC;
val €all_fc_tac› : THM list -> TACTIC;
val €asm_forward_chain_tac› : THM list -> TACTIC;
val €asm_fc_tac› : THM list -> TACTIC;
val €all_asm_forward_chain_tac› : THM list -> TACTIC;
val €all_asm_fc_tac› : THM list -> TACTIC;
=DESCRIBE
These are tactics which use theorems whose conclusions are
implications, or from which implications can be derived using
the canonicalisation function
=INLINEFT
fc_canon
=TEX
, q.v., to reason forwards from the assumptions of a goal. (The names
with
=INLINEFT
fc
=TEX
\ are aliases for the corresponding ones with
=INLINEFT
forward_chain
=TEX
.)

The basic step is to take a theorem of the form
=INLINEFT
á Ù t1 ¥ t2
=TEX
\ and an assumption of the form
=INLINEFT
t1'
=TEX
\ where $t1'$ is a substitution instance of $t1$ and to deduce the
corresponding instance of $t2'$. The new theorem,
=INLINEFT
Ñ Ù t2'
=TEX
\ say, may then be stripped into the assumptions.

In the case of
=INLINEFT
fc_tac
=TEX
\ the implicative theorem is always derived from the list
of theorems given as an argument.
In the case of
=INLINEFT
asm_fc_tac
=TEX
\ the assumptions are also used.
In all of the tactics the rule
=INLINEFT
fc_canon
=TEX
\ is used to derive an implicative canonical form from the
candidate implicative theorems.
Normally combination of an implicative theorem and an assumption
is then tried in turn and all resulting theorems are stripped into
the assumptions of the goal.
However, if the chaining results contain a theorem whose conclusion is ¨FÆ then the first such found will be stripped
into the assumptions, and all other theorems discarded.

If one of the implications has the form
=INLINEFT
t1 ¥ t2 ¥ t3
=TEX
\ or
=INLINEFT
t1 ± t2 ¥ t3
=TEX
\ and if assumptions matching $t1$ and $t2$ are available,
=INLINEFT
fc_tac
=TEX
\ or
=INLINEFT
asm_fc_tac
=TEX
\ will derive an intermediate implication
=INLINEFT
t2 ¥ t3
=TEX
\ and
=INLINEFT
asm_fc_tac
=TEX
\ could then be used to derive $t3$.
The variants with $all\_$ may be used to derive $t3$ directly without
generating any intermediate implications in the assumptions.
They work like the corresponding tactic without $all\_$ but any theorems
which are derived which are themselves implications are not stripped into
the assumptions but instead are used recursively to derive further theorems.
When no new implications are derivable all of the non-implicative theorems
derived during the process are stripped into the assumptions.

Note that the use of
=INLINEFT
fc_canon
=TEX
\ implies that conversions from the
proof context are applied to generate implications.
E.g., in an appropriate proof-context covering set theory,
=INLINEFT
a Ä b
=TEX
\ might be treated as the implication
=INLINEFT
µx∑x ç a ¥ x ç b
=TEX
.
Also variables which appear free in a theorem are not considered as candidates
for instantiation
(in order to give some control over the number of results generated).
The tacticals,
=INLINEFT
FC_T1
=TEX
\ and
=INLINEFT
ASM_FC_T1
=TEX
\ may be used to avoid the use of
=INLINEFT
fc_canon
=TEX
.

For example, the tactic:
=GFT
asm_fc_tac[] THEN asm_fc_tac[]
=TEX
will prove the goal:
=GFT
{p x, µx∑p x ¥ q x, µx∑q x ¥ r x} r x.

These are tacticals which use theorems whose conclusions are
implications, or from which implications can be derived,
to reason forwards from the assumptions of a goal.
(The tacticals with
=INLINEFT
FC
=TEX
\ are aliases for the corresponding ones with
=INLINEFT
FORWARD_CHAIN
=TEX
.)

The description of
=INLINEFT
fc_tac
=TEX
\ should be consulted for the basic forward chaining algorithms used.
The significance of the final argument and of the presence or absence of
=INLINEFT
ASM
=TEX
\ and
=INLINEFT
ALL
=TEX
\ in the name is exactly as for
=INLINEFT
fc_tac
=TEX
\ and its relatives.

The tacticals allow variation of
the tactic generating function used to process the theorems derived
by the forward inference.
The tactic generating function to be used is given as the first
argument.

\paragraph{Examples}
=INLINEFT
fc_tac
=TEX
\ is the same as:
=INLINEFT
FC_T (MAP_EVERY strip_asm_tac)
=TEX
.

To rewrite the goal with the results of the forward inference one
could use

=DESCRIBE
These are tacticals which use theorems whose conclusions are
implications, or from which implications can be derived,
to reason forwards from the assumptions of a goal.
(The tacticals with
=INLINEFT
FC
=TEX
\ are aliases for the corresponding ones with
=INLINEFT
FORWARD_CHAIN
=TEX
.)

The description of
=INLINEFT
fc_tac
=TEX
\ should be consulted for the basic forward chaining algorithms used.
The significance of the final argument and of the presence or absence of
=INLINEFT
ASM
=TEX
\ and
=INLINEFT
ALL
=TEX
\ in the name is exactly as for
=INLINEFT
fc_tac
=TEX
\ and its relatives.

The tacticals allow variation of the canonicalisation function
used to obtain implications from the argument theorems and of
the tactic generating function used to process the theorems derived
by the forward inference.
The canonicalisation function to use is the first argument
and the tactic generating function is the second.
(Related tacticals with names ending in
=INLINEFT
T
=TEX
\ rather than
=INLINEFT
T1
=TEX
\ are also available for the simpler case when
wants to use the same canonicalisation function as
=INLINEFT
fc_tac
=TEX
\ and just to vary the tactic generating function.)

\paragraph{Examples}

If the theorem argument comprises only implications
which are to be used without canonicalisation, one might use:
=INLINEFT
FC_T1 id_canon (MAP_EVERY strip_asm_tac)
=TEX
.

If one has an instance of $t1$ as an assumption and one wishes to
use the bi-implication in a theorem of the form
=INLINEFT
Ù t1 ¥ (t2 § t3)
=TEX
\ for rewriting, one might use
=INLINEFT
FC_T1 id_canon rewrite_tac
=TEX
.

The $all\_$ variants of all the above forward chaining tactics and
tacticals are intended to be particularly relevant for Z, since in Z
one often has, e.g., an equation universally quantified over several
variables and to get an instance of the equation into the assumptions
requires discharging one set membership condition for each bound
variables as it is specialised.

\subsection{Concerning Stripping}
=DOC
val €step_strip_tac› : TACTIC;
val €step_strip_asm_tac› : THM -> TACTIC;
=DESCRIBE
These functions provide methods of single-stepping through the application of $strip\-\_tac$ and $strip\-\_asm\-\_tac$ (q.v.).

When stripping the antecedent of an implication ,or a theorem, into the assumption list $strip\-\_tac$ and $strip\-\_asm\-\_tac$ respectively do all their stripping in one application of the tactic.
This is not appropriate behaviour when:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Explaining the detailed behaviour of these functions by example
applications.
\item
Attempting to ``debug'' a failed or inappropriate stripping.
\item
When a partial strip into the assumption list is desired.
\end{enumerate}
The two functions provided give a single-step stripping of antecedents and theorems.
They represent sets of objects that are partially stripped into
the assumption list by making the conclusion of the resulting goal an implication with the antecedent being the conjunction of the
partially stripped objects and the consequent being the unstripped part of the goal.
Repeated use of the provided functions closely corresponds to the processing order and effect of $strip\-\_tac$ and $strip\-\_asm\-\_tac$.
Under certain unusual circumstances the match may not be exact.
=EXAMPLE
Ù? ((a ≤ b) ± c) ¥ ((a ± c) ≤ (b ± c))
Single steps to:
Ù? (a ± c) ¥ ((a ± c) ≤ (b ± c))
and Ù? (b ± c) ¥ ((a ± c) ≤ (b ± c))
Each single step to:
a Ù? c ¥ ((a ± c) ≤ (b ± c))
and b Ù? c ¥ ((a ± c) ≤ (b ± c))
Each single step to:
a, c Ù? ¥ ((a ± c) ≤ (b ± c))
and b, c Ù? ¥ ((a ± c) ≤ (b ± c))
=TEX
These five steps (two on each branch) map onto one call of
$strip\_tac$.
=FAILURE
28003	There is no stripping technique for ?0 in the current proof context
=ENDDOC
Some ``unusual circumstances'' when the above do not correspond to  $strip\-\_tac$ and $strip\-\_asm\-\_tac$ are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
If a conversion in the proof context for stripping theorems
is applicable to conjuncts then it might not be applied in the single stripping case.
\item
If a conversion in the proof context has side effects these might interfere with the main goal, etc, in different manners, though the
order of occurrence of the side effects should normally be the same.
\item
Some of the processing that a single call of $strip\_tac$ would do before
determining that a subgoal has been proved may not
occur in the single-step case,
due to the single step functions being unable to distinguish
whether certain conclusions were formed from partially
stripped objects, or were part of the original goal.
This only affects the amount of processing, not the equivalence of the result.
\end{enumerate}

The induction principle, $thm$ has the form:

=GFT

\begin{enumerate}
\item

val €VAR_ELIM_NTH_ASM_T› : int -> (THM -> TACTIC) -> TACTIC;
=DESCRIBE
These tactics and tacticals do variable elimination with a chosen assumption of the goal.
They take an assumption of the form:
=INLINEFT
¨var = valueÆ
=TEX
{} or
=INLINEFT
¨value = varÆ
=TEX
{}, where $var$ is a variable and, if the subterm $value$ does not contain $var$ free, they substitute $value$ for the free variable $var$ throughout the goal (discarding the original assumption).

If an assumption is an equation of variables,
then the tactic will strip digits and the current variant suffix from the right of the two variable names, and will choose to eliminate the variable with the shortest remaining name string, taking eliminating the left hand side variable if the strings are of equal length
(this is a heuristic).
If the variables are the same then the assumption is just discarded with no further effect.

$var\_elim\_asm\_tac$ will determine whether its term argument is an assumption of the above form.
If so,
it will substitute for the free variable $var$ with $value$ throughout the goal, stripping any changed assumptions back into the goal (returning the rest by $check\_asm\_tac$), and then discard the original assumption.
$VAR\_ELIM\_ASM\_T$ allows the users choice of function to be applied to the modified assumptions.

$var\_elim\_nth\_asm\_tac$ works as $var\_elim\_asm\_tac$, except it takes an integer indicating the ``nth'' assumption is to be used.

{}, where $var$ is a variable and the subterm $value$ satisfies a tactic-specific requirement, eliminating the variable $var$ in favour of the $value$.

If an assumption is an equation of variables,
which all of the listed tactics accept,
then the tactic will strip digits and the current variant suffix from the right of the two variable names, and will choose to eliminate the variable with the shortest remaining name string, taking eliminating the left hand side variable if the strings are of equal length
(this is a heuristic).
If the variables are the same then the assumption is just discarded with no further effect.

$all\_var\_elim\_asm\_tac$ will first extract
all the goal's assumptions, holding them in a ``pool''.
It will examine each assumption of the required form in turn, starting at the assumptions from the head of the assumption list.
To eliminate a variable $var$ using an assumption it requires that the $value$ to which it is equated is also a variable, or an isolated constant
(this is more restrictive than $var\_elim\_asm\_tac$).
All the occurrences of the variable will be eliminated from the rest of the assumptions in the pool,
and from the conclusion of the goal, and the assumption discarded from the pool.
Each of the assumptions in the pool will be examined once,
as the process described so far will only exceptionally introduce new equations that can be used for variable elimination.

Finally, the remaining assumptions in the pool will be returned to the
goal's assumption list - if an individual assumption is unchanged then it
will be returned by $check\_asm\_tac$, otherwise it will be stripped
back into the assumption list by $strip\_asm\_tac$.
This stripping may result in further possible variable eliminations being enabled,
and indeed certain fairly unlikely combinations of assumptions and proof contexts may result in

REPEAT all_var_elim_asm_tac

{} not halting.
$ALL\_VAR\_ELIM\_ASM\_T$ allows the users choice of function to be applied to the modified assumptions, rather than $strip\_asm\_tac$.

$all\_var\_elim\_asm\_tac1$ works as $all\_var\_elim\_asm\_tac$, except that an assumption will be used to eliminate
a variable $var$ if the $value$ to which it is equated does not contain $var$ free (i.e. its requirement is as $var\_elim\_asm\_tac$).
$ALL\_VAR\_ELIM\_ASM\_T1$ allows the users choice of function to be applied to the modified assumptions.

All the functions fail if they find no assumptions that
can be used to eliminate variables.

\section{TACTICALS}

val €THEN_T1› : (TACTIC * TACTIC) -> TACTIC;
val €THEN1› : (TACTIC * TACTIC) -> TACTIC;
=DESCRIBE
$THEN\_T1$ is a tactical used as an infix operator.
$tac1$ $THEN\_T1$ $tac2$ is the tactic that applies $tac1$
and then applies $tac2$ to the first of the resulting subgoals
and $id\_tac$ to any other subgoals.
If $tac1$ returns no subgoals, then nor will $tac1$ $THEN\_T1$ $tac2$.
$THEN1$ is an alias for $THEN\_T1$.

It is intended for use in conjunction with induction tactics or
tactics like $lemma\_tac$ for which the first subgoal (i.e., the base
case of the induction or the lemma) often has a simple proof.

val €pair_rw_canon› : CANON;

	≥_rewrite_canon,

	§_t_rewrite_canon]));
=TEX
This is the repeated application of the first applicable
operation in the following list:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
stripping universal quantifiers (paired or simple);
\item
dividing conjunctive theorems into their conjuncts;
\item
changing $Ù≥(t1 ≤ t2)$ to $≥t1 ± ≥t2$;
\item
changing $Ù≥∂vs∑t$ to $µvs∑≥t$;
\item
changing $Ù≥≥t$ to $t § F$;
\item
changing $Ù≥t$ to $t § F$;
\item
if none of the above apply, changing $Ùt$ to $Ùt § T$.
\end{enumerate}

Finally, after all this canonicalisation we then universally quantify
the resulting theorems in all free variables other than those
that were free in the original.
