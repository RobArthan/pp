\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
third grouping of tactics, in particular those concerning paired abstractions.
This is called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD012}.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP029}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
third grouping of tactics, in particular those concerning paired abstractions.

The document provides groups of tactics, related by their core operator.

All functions require all their arguments to begin evaluation,
unless otherwise noted.

Note also that the order of declaration given in this document will
not necessarily reflect the order of implementation in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP029}.

We use the notation ``varstruct'' for ``an allowed variable structure, under ICL HOL syntax''.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Loading this document is dependent on those
files indicated as preceding it in the ICL HOL release 001 makefile.

\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
Many.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
Many.

\section{INFIX DIRECTIVES}
A Standard ML $infix$ command must be given at the ``top level''.
Thus we give the commands here for those functions declared in the following signatures.
=SML
=TEX
\section{Tactics III}
=DOC
signature âTactics IIIá = sig
=DESCRIBE
This provides the grouping of tactics for ICL HOL.
They are primarily concerned with handling paired abstractions.

\subsection{Concerning Tautologies}
The following are all implemented using $taut\_tac$.
=DOC
val âtaut_ruleá : TERM -> THM;
=DESCRIBE
A tautology prover.
A tautology is taken to be any substitution
instance of a term which is formed from boolean variables,
the constants $T$ and $F$ and the following
connectives:
ó
€, , Š, ‚, Œ, if ... then ... else
æ
and which is true for any assignment of truth values to the variables.
If its argument is a tautology then the
function will return that term as a theorem.

=FAILURE

27037	?0 is not tautologically true
=ENDDOC
This is not a conversion, but there are two conversions leading
from it:
=DOC
val âtaut_convá : CONV;
=DESCRIBE
A tautology prover.
A tautology is taken to be any substitution
instance of a term which is formed from boolean variables,
the constants $T$ and $F$ and the following
connectives:
ó
€, , Š, ‚, Œ, if ... then ... else
æ
and which is true for any assignment of truth values to the variables.
If its argument is a tautologically true term, then the
function will return a theorem that the term is equivalent to $T$.

val âtaut_eq_convá : TERM -> CONV;

A tautology prover.
A tautology is taken to be any substitution
instance of a term which is formed from boolean variables,
the constants $T$ and $F$ and the following
connectives:
ó
€, , Š, ‚, Œ, if ... then ... else
æ
and which is true for any assignment of truth values to the variables.
âtaut_ruleáIf its two boolean arguments are tautologically equal terms, then the
function will return a theorem that the terms are equal.

\subsection{Concerning Assumptions}
=DOC
val âspec_asm_tacá : TERM -> TERM -> TACTIC;
val âlist_spec_asm_tacá : TERM -> TERM list -> TACTIC;
val âspec_nth_asm_tacá : int -> TERM -> TACTIC;
val âlist_spec_nth_asm_tacá : int -> TERM list -> TACTIC;
=DESCRIBE
These are four methods of specialising asssumptions,
differing by single or lists of values to specialise to,
and in the method of selection of the assumption.
All of them discard the old assumption, and place the
result onto the assumption list using $strip\_asm\_tac$.
If the desired behaviour differs from any of those supplied
then use $GET\_ASM\_T$ and its cousins.
