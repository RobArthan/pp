\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
third grouping of tactics, in particular those concerning paired abstractions.
This is called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD012}.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP029}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
third grouping of tactics, in particular those concerning paired abstractions.

The document provides groups of tactics, related by their core operator.

All functions require all their arguments to begin evaluation,
unless otherwise noted.

Note also that the order of declaration given in this document will
not necessarily reflect the order of implementation in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP029}.

We use the notation ``varstruct'' for ``an allowed variable structure, under ICL HOL syntax''.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Loading this document is dependent on \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP026}.
It is implemented in theory ``pair''.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
None known.

signature ÛTactics3Ý = sig
=DESCRIBE
This provides the grouping of tactics for ICL HOL.
They are primarily concerned with adding handling for paired abstractions.

\subsection{Concerning Tautologies}
The following are all implemented using $simple\_taut\_tac$.
=DOC
val Ûtaut_tacÝ : TACTIC;
=DESCRIBE
A tautology prover.
If the conclusion of the goal is a tautology then $taut\_tac$ will prove
the goal.
A tautology is taken to be any (perhaps universally quantified) substitution
instance of a term which is formed from boolean variables,
the constants $T$ and $F$ and the following
connectives:
=GFT
±, ², ´, ¤, ³, if ... then ... else
=TEX
and which is true for any assignment of truth values to the variables.
=FRULE 2 Tactic

$strip\_tac$, $taut\_rule$, $taut\_conv$,
$simple\_taut\_tac$.
=FAILURE
29020	Conclusion of the goal is not a universally quantified tautology
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûtaut_ruleÝ : TERM -> THM;
=DESCRIBE
A tautology prover.
A tautology is taken to be any universally quantified substitution
instance of a term which is formed from boolean variables,
the constants $T$ and $F$ and the following
connectives:
=GFT
±, ², ´, ¤, ³, if ... then ... else
=TEX
and which is true for any assignment of truth values to the variables.
If its argument is such a tautology then the
function will return that term as a theorem.

=ENDDOC
This is not a conversion, but there are two conversions leading
from it:
=DOC
val Ûtaut_convÝ : CONV;
=DESCRIBE
A tautology prover.
A tautology is taken to be any universally quantified substitution
instance of a term which is formed from boolean variables,
the constants $T$ and $F$ and the following
connectives:
=GFT
±, ², ´, ¤, ³, if ... then ... else
=TEX
and which is true for any assignment of truth values to the variables.
If its argument is a tautologically true term, then the
function will return a theorem that the term is equivalent to $T$.

\subsection{Concerning ³}

connectives using the following rules:

theorem tactic to the result of transforming a theorem
by moving a top level negation inside other predicate calculus
connectives using the following rules:

conclusion,
including
those redexes introduced by preceding $Â$-reductions
in the same tactic application.

rewriting would do ``too much''.

These are four methods of specialising asssumptions,
differing by single or lists of values to specialise to,
and in the method of selection of the assumption.
All of them leave the old assumption in place, and place the

lists of equations for use in rewriting. They four perform the following
transformations:

val Ûpair_rw_canonÝ : CANON;

This is the rewrite canonicalisation function for the theory of pairs,
defined as
=GFT
val pair_rw_canon =
	REWRITE_CAN
	(REPEAT_CAN(FIRST_CAN [
	µ_rewrite_canon,
	±_rewrite_canon,
	³_rewrite_canon,
	f_rewrite_canon,
	¤_t_rewrite_canon]));
=TEX
This is the repeated application of the first applicable
operation in the following list:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
stripping universal quantifiers (paired or simple);
\item
dividing conjunctive theorems into their conjuncts;
\item
changing $ô³(t1 ² t2)$ to $³t1 ± ³t2$;
\item
changing $ô³¶vs·t$ to $µvs·³t$;
\item
changing $ô³³t$ to $t ¤ F$;
\item
changing $ô³t$ to $t ¤ F$;
\item
if none of the above apply, changing $ôt$ to $ôt ¤ T$.
\end{enumerate}

Finally, after all this canonicalisation we then universally quantify
the resulting theorems in all free variables other than those
that were free in the original.
