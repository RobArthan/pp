\subsection{Changes forecast}
Most of the text outside the documentation boxes is a discussion
of the design process, rather than being part of the final design.
It will thus be removed or rephrased in later issues.
\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
derived rules of inference.
This is called for in section ??? of ???.
The high-level specification for the code is
given in ???.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP007}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
derived rules of inference in Release 001 of ICL HOL.
Though other rules of inference may be introduced, this 
document should provide a core set, at least covering the rules
of natural deduction, and providing at least easy access to the functionality
of the rules of inference for the prototype ICL HOL.
Studies of this coverage may be found in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/WRK013} and
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/WRK014}.

The document provides groups of rules of inference, related by their core operator.
The text surrounding the documentation will note when one of the group will be found in the abstract data type $THM$ (\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD006}),
or when we choose not to implement a rule called for by our claimed minimum coverage.

All functions require all their arguments to begin evaluation,
unless otherwise noted.

Note also that the order of declaration given in this document will
not necessarily reflect the order of implementation in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP007}.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Loading this document is dependent on those
files indicated as preceding it in the ICL HOL release 001 makefile.

This document places requirements upon the constants handled by the
inference rules discussed.
In summary, the requirements are that the definitions of the constants must be such that the designs of the rules are satisfiable.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}

\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
\section{INFIX DIRECTIVES}
A Standard ML $infix$ command must be given at the `top level'.
Thus we give the commands here for those functions declared in the following signatures.
=SML
infix 4 THEN_C;
infix 4 ORELSE_C;
=TEX
(The priorities given are probably not appropriate)
\section{THE DERIVED RULES OF REASONING}
=DOC
signature âDerivedInferenceRulesá = sig
=DESCRIBE
This provides the derived rules of inference in Release 001 of ICL HOL.
Though other rules of inference may be introduced, this 
document's signature should provide a core set, at least covering the common rules
of natural deduction.
=ENDDOC
We include in this structure the abstract datatype $THM$, and its
constituents, which include primitive and built-in rules of inference,
as well as theory management material.

=FAILURE
7076	Could not match term to LHS of theorem
=ENDDOC
An alternative method of indicating what may be instantiated 
is to give a ``forbidden list'' of variables that may not be instantiated,
whether they be universally quantified or free in the original theorem.
This could of course be a ``only modify'' list instead.

As this is calculated once per application of $match\_eq\_conv1$ to a theorem, and not once per application to a term, it is not 
a major potential time-saver either way.
What this function must be fast at is its application to a term.

We may want a specialised $term\_match$ function that understands
a ``forbidden list'' of variables that it may not modify.

We might also want some way of matching, such that free variables in the assumption list are also instantiated. This would work best with a ``forbidden list'' style, rather than a style that only
allows the universally quantified variables to be instantiated.
This question is particularly important if we want the possibility
of clever assumption introduction mechanisms during rewriting,
especially those involved in rewriting with implications.

where »t'¼ is »t¼, rewritten according to the parameters of the

The function is partially evaluable with any number of its arguments present, though in some cases partial evaluation is not considered
likely to be of use.
The parameters have the following effects:
\begin{description}
\item[other\_conv]
If no rewriting can be done on a particular sub-term, but it
matches (by free variable and type instantiation) any terms of this
list, then each of the associated conversions will be applied until
one succeeds, or all fail.
This can be used to cause, e.g., $\beta$ reduction, during rewriting.
\item[canon]
This function will be applied to both the $basis$ and $with$ theorems, to produce a list of theorems to be rewritten with from these inputs.
This will generally involve producing canonical or simplified
forms of the original theorems.
We will attempt the rewrite each term with the theorems derived from $with$, in the order left by $canon$,
before trying with those derived from $basis$, again in the order left by $canon$,
on that term.

The resulting theorems will be (perhaps) universally 
quantified theorems, that the rewriting may instantiate in any or all of their 
universally quantified variables, or any of their type variables,
to match the term being rewritten.
They will not be instantiated in any free variables.
\item[basis]
This is a basic set of theorems to rewrite with.
$prim\_rewrite\_conv$ will be partially evaluable with just
$canon$ and $basis$ as arguments, which is the only reason for having two theorem list arguments.
\item[traverse]
This is a conversional, which defines the traversal of term $t$ by the
rewriting conversion derived from $prim\_rewrite\_conv$'s other arguments.
\item[with]
This is an additional set of theorems to be processed by $canon$
and the results used in rewriting.
\end{description}

These are the standard patterns of rewriting inference rules,
all based upon $prim\_rewrite\_rule$(q.v.).
They all use the canonicalisation rule $rewrite\_canon$(q.v.) to
process their theorems.

If a rule is ``pure'' then there are no default rewrite theorems,
otherwise the rewriting theorems given by $set\_basic\_rewrites$
(q.v.) will be the default rewriting theorems, and any $\beta$ redexes will be reduced.
That is the function will attempt to rewrite each sub-term first with user supplied theorems, and if it can't then it will try to
rewrite with the $basic\_rewrites$, and if not that, it will attempt to reduce any $\beta$ redexes.

If a rule is ``once'' then rewriting will proceed from the root
of the rewritten conclusion's theorem, towards the leaves,
and will not descend through any rewritten subterm.
If not, rewriting will continue, moving from the root to the leaves, repeating if any rewriting is successful, until there is no rewriting redex
anywhere within the rewritten conclusion.
This may cause non-terminating looping.

If a rule is ``asm'' then the theorems rewritten with will include
the $asm\_rule$d assumptions of the theorem being rewritten.
The function will first try to rewrite with the user supplied
theorems, then with the assumptions, and then with any default
theorems (e.g. $basic\_rewrites$ if not a ``pure'' rewrite).

If a rule is ``fasm'' then the theorems rewritten with will include
the $asm\_rule$d assumptions which satisfy the predicate on terms supplied of the theorem being rewritten.
The function will first try to rewrite with the user supplied
theorems, then with the assumptions, and then with any default
theorems (e.g. $basic\_rewrites$ if not a ``pure'' rewrite).

These are the standard patterns of rewriting conversions,

They all use the canonicalisation rule $rewrite\_canon$(q.v.) to
process their theorems.

If a conversion is ``pure'' then there are no default rewrite theorems,
otherwise the $basic\_rewrites$ will be the default rewriting theorems and any $\beta$ redexes will be reduced.
That is the function will attempt to rewrite each sub-term first with user supplied theorems, and if it can't then it will try to
rewrite with the theorems given to $set\_basic\_rewrites$(q.v.), and finally will try reducing a
$\beta$ redex.

If a conversion is ``once'' then rewriting will proceed from the root
of the rewritten conversion's term argument, towards the leaves,
and will not descend through any rewritten subterm.
If not, rewriting will continue moving from the root to the leaves, repeating if any rewriting is successful, until there is no rewriting redex

\subsubsection{Term Traversal Algorithms for Conversions}

The following traversal schemes are those provided by Cambridge HOL,
and are by no means a complete set of ``reasonable'' traversal schemes.
Indeed, $RE\_TRAVERSE\_C$ is unlikely to ever be an efficient traversal scheme merely complete.
=DOC
val âONCE_TRAVERSE_Cá : CONV -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This traverses a term from the root node to its leaves,
attempting to apply its conversion argument.
If it successfully applies the conversion to any subterm
then it will not further traverse that subterm,
but will still continue on other branches.
If it fails to apply its conversion to a leaf, it then applies $refl\_conv$.
It traverses from left to right, though this should only matter for
conversions that work by side-effect.
($ONCE\_DEPTH\_CONV$ in Cambridge HOL).
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val âTRAVERSE_Cá : CONV -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This traverses a term from its leaves to its root node.
It will repeat the application of its conversion argument, until failure,
on each subterm encountered en route.
At each node the conversion is applied to the sub-term that results from the application of the preceding traversal, not the original.
It traverses from left to right, though this should only matter for
conversions that work by side-effect.
($DEPTH\_CONV$ in Cambridge HOL).
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val âREPEAT_TRAVERSE_Cá : CONV -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This traverses a term from its leaves to its root node.
It will repeat the application of its conversion argument, until failure,
on each subterm encountered en route.
At each node the conversion is applied to the sub-term that results from the application of the preceding traversal, not the original.
At any subterm the conversion is successfully applied, the resulting
subterm will be completely re-traversed once more.
It traverses from left to right, though this should only matter for
conversions that work by side-effect.
($REDEPTH\_CONV$ in Cambridge HOL).
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val âTOP_TRAVERSE_Cá : CONV -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This traverses a term from its root node to its leaves.
It will repeat the application of its conversion argument, until failure,
on each subterm encountered en route.
It descends through the sub-term that results from the application of the preceding traversal, not the original.
It traverses from left to right, though this should only matter for
conversions that work by side-effect.

\subsubsection{Conversions as Rules}
=DOC
val âconv_ruleá : CONV -> THM -> THM;

=RULE

\subsection{Canonicalisation for Rewriting}
=DOC
val ârewrite_canoná : THM list -> THM list
=DESCRIBE
This is the canonicalisation function used in $rewrite\_conv$ and
its relatives.
The list is produced by processing each member of the list, resulting in a list of theorems. 
This list will be aded to those produced so far, bar duplicates.

The individual theorem processing is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Strip universal quantifiers (by $strip\_ƒ\_rule$) and conjuncts 
($strip\_€\_rule$) until the result theorems are niether
conjunctions nor universally quantified.
\item
Theorems of the form `$ö\ … t1 = t2$' and `$ö\ … t1 ‚ t2$'
will be left alone, those of the form `$ö\ … Œ t$' will
be changed to `$ö\ … t ‚ F$', and all others will be changed to
the form `$ö\ … t ‚ T$' by $‚\_T\_intro$.
\item
All the resulting theorems will be universally quantified.
\end{enumerate}
=ENDDOC
A variant canonicalisation would strip implications
into the assumption list, as well as adding the unstripped form.
The effects caused by this could be unfortunate if unconstrained,
and so it is not a default action.
