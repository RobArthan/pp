\subsection{Changes history}
\begin{description}
\item [Issue 1.1]
First version.
\item [Issue 1.2]
Changes after RDA comments.
\item [Issue 1.3,1.4]
Moved statements about Cambridge HOL outside of documentation
boxes.
Added some conversions paralleling the functionality of some of the rules given in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD006} and this document.
\item [Issue 1.5]
Put in designs for primitive and built-in rules,
derived from \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD006}.
Some tidying up.
\item [Issue 1.6]
Changed $suc\_conv$ to fail if given $0$, as in proto-type.
Various changes to error messages, introduced a few new
conversionals.
Primitive and built-in inference rules, and conversionals
all module tested to these designs.
\item [Issue 1.7]
Corrected minor errors.
\end{description}
\subsection{Changes forecast}
Most of the text outside the documentation boxes is a discussion
of the design process, rather than being part of the final design.
It will thus be removed or rephrased in later issues.
\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
derived rules of inference.
This is called for in section ??? of ???.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP007}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
derived rules of inference in Release 001 of ICL HOL.
Though other rules of inference may be introduced, this 
document should provide a core set, at least covering the rules
of natural deduction, and providing at least easy access to the functionality
of the rules of inference for the prototype ICL HOL.
Studies of this coverage may be found in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/WRK013} and
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/WRK014}.

The document provides groups of rules of inference, related by their core operator.
Certain inference rules are noted as primitive, or built-in.
This means that their implementation will just be ``sugar'' surrounding a call to an inference rule from \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD006}, the new name being formed by stripping off the prefix $icl'$ from the name in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD006}.

All functions require all their arguments to begin evaluation,
unless otherwise noted.

Note also that the order of declaration given in this document will
not necessarily reflect the order of implementation in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP007}.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Loading this document is dependent on those
files indicated as preceding it in the ICL HOL release 001 makefile.

This document places requirements upon the constants handled by the
inference rules discussed.
In summary, the requirements are that the definitions of the constants must be such that the designs of the rules are satisfiable.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}

\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
\section{INFIX DIRECTIVES}
A Standard ML $infix$ command must be given at the ``top level''.
Thus we give the commands here for those functions declared in the following signatures.
=SML
infix 4 THEN_C;
infix 4 ORELSE_C;
infix 4 FURTHER_C;
infix 4 EITHER_C;
=TEX
(The priorities given are probably not appropriate)
\section{THE DERIVED RULES OF REASONING}
=DOC
signature âDerivedInferenceRulesá = sig
=DESCRIBE
This provides the derived rules of inference in Release 001 of ICL HOL.
Though other rules of inference may be introduced, this 
document's signature should provide a core set, at least covering the common rules
of natural deduction.
It subsumes the inference rules of the abstract data type $THM$.

=TEX
$subst\_rule$ $[(thm_1, x_1),\ldots,(thm_n, x_n)]$ $template$ $thm$
returns a theorem in which $template$ determines where in $thm$ the $thm_i$ are substituted.
The $x_i$ must be variables.
The template is of the form $t[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, and wherever the $x_i$ are free in $template$ their associated equality theorem, $thm_i$,
is substituted into $thm$.
The rule will rename as necessary to avoid bound variable capture.
The assumption list of the resulting theorem will be the union of all
substitution theorems, regardless of use.

The conclusion of the resulting theorem will take its bound variable names
from $template$, not $thm$, as shown in the following example.
This provides an $\alpha$-conversion facility.

The function will usefully partially evaluate with one or two arguments.

$subst\_conv$ $[(thm_1, x_1),\ldots,(thm_n, x_n)]$ $template$ $term$
returns a theorem in which $template$ determines where in $term$ the $thm_i$ are substituted, when forming the RHS of the equation.
The $x_i$ must be variables.
The template is of the form $t[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, and wherever the $x_i$ are free in $template$ their associated equality theorem, $thm_i$,
is substituted into $thm$.
The rule will rename as necessary to avoid bound variable capture.
The assumption list of the resulting theorem will be the union of all
substitution theorems, regardless of use.

The RHS of the resulting theorem will take its bound variable names
from $template$, not $term$, as shown in the following example.
This provides an $\alpha$-conversion facility.

An alternative method of indicating what may be instantiated 
is to give a ``forbidden list'' of variables that may not be instantiated,
whether they be universally quantified or free in the original theorem.
This could of course be a ``only modify'' list instead.

As this is calculated once per application of $eq\_match\_conv1$ to a theorem, and not once per application to a term, it is not 
a major potential time-saver either way.
What this function must be fast at is its application to a term.

We may want a specialised $term\_match$ function that understands
a ``forbidden list'' of variables that it may not modify.

We might also want some way of matching, such that free variables in the assumption list are also instantiated. This would work best with a ``forbidden list'' style, rather than a style that only
allows the universally quantified variables to be instantiated.
This question is particularly important if we want the possibility
of clever assumption introduction mechanisms during rewriting,
especially those involved in rewriting with implications.

conversion, and $ö$ are the assumptions required to allow the
rewriting.

The function is partially evaluable with any number of its arguments present, though in some cases partial evaluation is not considered
likely to be of use.
The parameters have the following effects:
\begin{description}
\item[other\_conv]
If a particular sub-term
matches (by free variable and type instantiation) any terms of this
list, then the associated conversions will be added to the applicable rewrite conversions generated by the following arguments.
Members of the list will be applied to the sub-term until
one succeeds, or all fail.
This can be used to cause, e.g., $\beta$ reduction, during rewriting.
\item[canon]
This function will be applied to both the $basis$ and $with$ theorems, to produce a list of theorems to be rewritten with from these inputs.
This will generally involve producing canonical or simplified
forms of the original theorems.

The resulting theorems will be (perhaps) universally 
quantified theorems, that the rewriting may instantiate in any or all of their 
universally quantified variables, or any of their type variables,
to match the term being rewritten.
They will not be instantiated in any free variables.
\item[basis]
This is a basic set of theorems to rewrite with.
$prim\_rewrite\_conv$ will be partially evaluable with just
$canon$ and $basis$ as arguments, which is the only reason for having two theorem list arguments.
\item[traverse]
This is a conversional, which defines the traversal of term $t$ by the
rewriting conversion derived from $prim\_rewrite\_conv$'s other arguments.
\item[with]
This is an additional set of theorems to be processed by $canon$
and the results used in rewriting.

These are the standard patterns of rewriting inference rules,
all based upon $prim\_rewrite\_rule$(q.v.).
They all use the canonicalisation rule $rewrite\_canon$(q.v.) to
process their theorems.

If a rule is ``pure'' then there are no default rewrite theorems,
otherwise the rewriting theorems given by $set\_basic\_rewrites$
(q.v.) will be the default rewriting theorems, and any $\beta$ redexes will be reduced.

If a rule is ``once'' then rewriting will proceed from the root
of the rewritten conclusion's theorem, towards the leaves,
and will not descend through any rewritten subterm.
If not, rewriting will continue, moving from the root to the leaves, repeating if any rewriting is successful, until there is no rewriting redex
anywhere within the rewritten conclusion.
This may cause non-terminating looping.

If a rule is ``asm'' then the theorems rewritten with will include
the $asm\_rule$d assumptions of the theorem being rewritten.

If a rule is ``fasm'' then the theorems rewritten with will include
the $asm\_rule$d assumptions which satisfy the predicate on terms supplied of the theorem being rewritten.

The following traversal schemes are those provided by Cambridge HOL,
and are by no means a complete set of ``reasonable'' traversal schemes.
Indeed, $REPEAT\_TRAVERSE\_C$ is unlikely to ever be an efficient traversal scheme, but merely complete.

When they fail, the resulting error message is somewhat ``non-deterministic'', it may 
come from a function implementing the traversal scheme used,
or from the conversion traversed through the term.
=DOC
val âONCE_TRAVERSE_Cá : CONV -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This traverses a term from the root node to its leaves,
attempting to apply its conversion argument.
If it successfully applies the conversion to any subterm
then it will not further traverse that subterm,
but will still continue on other branches.
If it fails to apply its conversion to a leaf, its functionality is equivalent to then applying $refl\_conv$.
It traverses from left to right, though this should only matter for
conversions that work by side-effect.
It will fail if the conversion succeeds nowhere in the tree,
or if the results of certain conversion applications are ill-formed.
=ENDDOC
($ONCE\_DEPTH\_CONV$ in Cambridge HOL)
=DOC
val âTRAVERSE_Cá : CONV -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This traverses a term from its leaves to its root node.
It will repeat the application of its conversion argument, until failure,
on each subterm encountered en route.
At each node the conversion is applied to the sub-term that results from the application of the preceding traversal, not the original.
It traverses from left to right, though this should only matter for
conversions that work by side-effect.
It fails if the conversion applies nowhere within the tree.
=ENDDOC
($DEPTH\_CONV$ in Cambridge HOL)
=DOC
val âREPEAT_TRAVERSE_Cá : CONV -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This traverses a term from its leaves to its root node.
It will attempt the application of its conversion argument
on each subterm encountered en route.
If the conversion is successfully applied 
to a given sub-term,
then the resulting sub-term from the conversion
is re-traversed by the function.
It traverses from left to right, though this should only matter for
conversions that work by side-effect.
It fails if the conversion is not applicable anywhere within
the term, or if certain applications of the conversion
have ill-formed results.
=ENDDOC
($REDEPTH\_CONV$ in Cambridge HOL)
=DOC
val âTOP_TRAVERSE_Cá : CONV -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This traverses a term from its root node to its leaves.
It will repeat the application of its conversion argument, until failure,
on each subterm encountered en route.
It descends through the sub-term that results from the application of the preceding traversal, not the original.
It traverses from left to right, though this should only matter for
conversions that work by side-effect.
It fails if the conversion is applied nowhere within the term.

\subsubsection{Conversions as Rules}
=DOC
val âconv_ruleá : CONV -> THM -> THM;

=RULE

\subsection{Canonicalisation for Rewriting}
=DOC
val ârewrite_canoná : THM list -> THM list
=DESCRIBE
This is the canonicalisation function used in $rewrite\_conv$ and
its relatives.
The list is produced by processing each member of the list, resulting in a list of theorems. 
This list will be added to those produced so far, bar duplicates.

The individual theorem processing is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Strip universal quantifiers (by $strip\_ƒ\_rule$) and conjuncts 
($strip\_€\_rule$) until the result theorems are neither
conjunctions nor universally quantified.
\item
Theorems of the form `$ö\ … t1 = t2$` and `$ö\ … t1 ‚ t2$`
will be left alone, those of the form `$ö\ … Œ t$` will
be changed to `$ö\ … t ‚ F$`, and all others will be changed to
the form `$ö\ … t ‚ T$` by $‚\_t\_intro$.
\item
All the resulting theorems then will be made closed 
(universally quantified in all free variables).
\end{enumerate}
=ENDDOC
A variant canonicalisation would strip implications
into the assumption list, as well as adding the unstripped form.
The effects caused by this could be unfortunate if unconstrained,
and so it is not a default action.
