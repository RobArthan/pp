\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for the
derived rules of inference.
This is called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD009}.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP007}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for some
derived rules of inference in Release 001 of ICL HOL.
Though other rules of inference will be introduced, this
document should provide a core set, at least covering the rules
of natural deduction, and providing at least easy access to the functionality
of the rules of inference for the prototype ICL HOL
(other than rewriting)
Studies of this coverage may be found in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/WRK013} and
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/WRK014}.
Rewriting rules are covered by \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD026}
and rules of inference concerning paired abstractions
(rather than simple quantifiers) in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD027}.

The document provides groups of rules of inference, related by their core operator.
Certain inference rules are noted as primitive, or built-in.
This means that their implementation will just be ``sugar'' surrounding a call to an inference rule from \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD006}, the new name being formed by stripping off the prefix $icl'$ from the name in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD006}.

All functions require all their arguments before they can be evaluated,
unless otherwise noted.
All functions require all their arguments to begin evaluation,
unless otherwise noted.

Note also that the order of declaration given in this document will
not necessarily reflect the order of implementation in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP007}.

All successful calls of inference rules given in this document,
other than the conversionals, are profiled
(i.e. a call to $prof$ will be made).
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Loading this document is dependent on those
files indicated as preceding it in the ICL HOL release 001 makefile.

This document places requirements upon the constants handled by the
inference rules discussed.
In summary, the requirements are that the definitions of the constants must be such that the designs of the rules are satisfiable.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
Some of the inference rules given may never be useful.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
As the choice of coverage is not rigidly defined, it is possible
some appropriate functions are not given.
\subsubsection{Terminology}
The following supplements the terminology used in those documents
upon which this one depends.
\begin{tabular}{p{1.3in} p{4.9in}}
existentially quantified theorem & a theorem whose conclusion is a $„$-term \\
uniquely existentially quantified theorem & a theorem whose conclusion is a $„_1$-term \\
\end{tabular}
\section{INFIX DIRECTIVES}
A Standard ML $infix$ command must be given at the ``top level''.
Thus we give the commands here for those functions declared in the following signatures.
=SML
infix 4 THEN_C;
infix 4 ORELSE_C;
infix 4 FURTHER_C;
infix 4 EITHER_C;
=TEX
(The priorities given are probably not appropriate)
\section{THE DERIVED RULES OF REASONING}
=DOC
signature âDerivedRules1á = sig
=DESCRIBE
This provides the derived rules of inference in Release 001 of ICL HOL.
Though other rules of inference may be introduced, this
document's signature should provide a core set, at least covering the common rules
of natural deduction.
It subsumes the inference rules of the abstract data type $THM$.
=ENDDOC
Note that unusable theorems (e.g. out of scope) will cause the functions underlying
this interface to raise, using $error$, messages 6036, 6065, 6066 and 6072.
These cannot, by convention be caught by the interface functions.
\subsection{Concerning Instantiation}
=DOC

=TEX
$inst\_type\_rule$ $talist$ $thm$ will instantiate each type variable in
$talist$ with its associated type.
It will decorate free variables that would become identified with
other variables (both in conclusion and assumptions)
by their types becoming the same and the names originally being the same.
To instantiate types in the assumption list, see $asm\_inst\_type\_rule$.

=ENDDOC
An alternative method of indicating what may be instantiated
is to give a ``forbidden list'' of variables that may not be instantiated,
whether they be universally quantified or free in the original theorem.
This could of course be a ``only modify'' list instead.

As this is calculated once per application of $eq\_match\_1_conv$ to a theorem, and not once per application to a term, it is not
a major potential time-saver either way.
What this function must be fast at is its application to a term.

We may want a specialised $term\_match$ function that understands
a ``forbidden list'' of variables that it may not modify.

We might also want some way of matching, such that free variables in the assumption list are also instantiated. This would work best with a ``forbidden list'' style, rather than a style that only
allows the universally quantified variables to be instantiated.
This question is particularly important if we want the possibility
of clever assumption introduction mechanisms during rewriting,
especially those involved in rewriting with implicative theorems.

It will attempt the application of its conversion argument
on each subterm encountered en route.
If the conversion is successfully applied
to a given sub-term,
then the resulting sub-term from the conversion
is re-traversed by the function.
It traverses from left to right, though this should only matter for
conversions that work by side-effect.
It fails if the conversion is not applicable anywhere within
the term, or if certain applications of the conversion
have ill-formed results.

val âTOP_MAP_Cá : CONV -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This traverses a term from its root node to its leaves.
It will repeat the application of its conversion argument, until failure,
on each subterm encountered en route.
It then descends through the sub-term that results from the application of the preceding traversal, not the original.
If the descent causes any change, on ``coming out'' it will attempt
to reapply its conversion to the result, and if successful
will then reapply $TOP\_MAP\_C$ of the conversion
as well.

It traverses from left to right, though this should only matter for
conversions that work by side-effect.
It fails if the conversion is applied nowhere within the term.

\subsubsection{Conversions as Rules}
=DOC
val âconv_ruleá : CONV -> THM -> THM;
=DESCRIBE
Apply a conversion to the conclusion of a theorem, and do $‚$ modus ponens between the original theorem and the result of the conversion
=RULE
conv_rule

É
ö1 … t
É
ö1 ¡ ö2 … t'
=TEX
where $c\ t$ gives $ö2 … t ‚ t'$.
=FAILURE
7104	Result of conversion, ?0, ill-formed
=FAILUREC
Also as the failure of the conversion upon the conclusion of the
theorem.

\section{TEST POLICY}
The functions in this document should be tested according to the general criteria described in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008}.
All the primitive and built-in functions should be tested
to ensure they do not block errors 6036, 6065 and 6066
caused in their calls to the kernel inference rules they
are based on.
