\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}

This document contains a detailed design of the file and terminal
reading and writing functions, called for by~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF002}
which discusses the lexical nature of the Release 1 ICL HOL.  The
design is implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP005}.

This version of the document should be regarded as a
placeholder, pending the creation of the proper document.

\subsection{Introduction}

Three routines for reading Standard~ML text with embedded pretty
characters are provided.  There is some incomplete support for
languages other than Standard~ML, attempting to use it will provoke a
failure exception from this package, or an error message from the
PolyML parser.


\section{READER WRITER}
=DOC
signature âReaderWriterá = sig
=DESCRIBE
File and terminal reading and writing functions.
=ENDDOC

=DOC
val âusefileá : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
Read Standard~ML with pretty characters allowed, from the named file.
=ENDDOC

=DOC
val âusestringá : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
Read Standard~ML with pretty characters allowed, from the given string.
=ENDDOC

=DOC
val âuseterminalá : unit -> unit
=DESCRIBE
Read Standard~ML with pretty characters allowed, from the terminal.
This routine takes over the terminal, it handles all exceptions as the
outermost level of the ML system.  To return to the default PolyML
terminal reader use $abandon_reader_writer$.

This routine prompts to the conventions of PolyML but uses the strings
``{\tt:>~}'' and ``{\tt:>~}'', the PolyML prompts do not have the
colon.

Typing control-D to this routine (when it is looking for input)
abandons the current {\em topdec.}
=ENDDOC

=DOC
val âabandon_reader_writerá : unit -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
Only meaningfully used after $useterminal$ has been called, when it
forces an exit from that routine.
