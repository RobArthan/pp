\subsection{Changes Forecast}

Some of the text in this document and in the
implementation~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP005} is more appropriate to the
system builder's guide~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR008} and should be
moved into that document.  When that happens the descriptions in the
reference manual entries should be rewritten to refer to the system
builder's guide.

Make $add_new_symbols$ errors 5100, 5101 and 5102 abandon the whole
operation.  This cannot be done until the extended character set is
rationalised.

Reduce the flexibility of general quotations by omitting the
$language_code$ in the syntax.

\section{GENERAL}

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Scope}

This document contains a detailed design of the file and terminal
reading and writing functions, called for by~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD008}.
These functions implement the extensions to Standard~ML detailed
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF002}
which discusses the lexical nature of the Release 1 ICL HOL.  The
design is implemented in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP005}.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Introduction}

The reader writer comprises two main parts, structures $ReaderWriter$
and $ReaderWriterSupport$, plus extensions for each of the supported
languages.  The first extension is in structure $HOLReaderWriter$ for
the HOL language.

The `basic reader writer' of the Release 1 ICL HOL system is
in structure $ReaderWriter$, it supports an
extension to Standard~ML that allows `extended characters' to be used in
Standard~ML text; in particular, in Standard~ML identifiers and
strings.  This interface is provided by a small number of functions, see
section~\ref{PrimaryUserInterface}.  These allow the enhanced ML text to
be read from the terminal, from a named text file, or from a
Standard~ML string.

A second part of the basic reader writer, the `embedding interface'
in structure $ReaderWriterSupport$,
allows readers for other languages to be embedded, allowing the
(enhanced) Standard~ML to be used as a metalanguage for supporting work
in other languages.  Part of the embedding interface provides for
characters in the user's source text to switch between languages, text
in an embedded language is treated as a Standard~ML string that is
passed as an argument to a language specific analysis routine ---
typically for lexical analysis, parsing, etc.

Within this document a reader writer for the HOL language is detailed,
it is added to the basic reader writer using the embedding interface.
Supporting the HOL language is a primary goal of the whole system,
within the reader writer it serves as a guide for the technique for
embedding other languages.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}

Some extensions to Standard~ML are given in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF002}
where they are described in terms of ``macro processing'' of the
extended Standard~ML to form Standard~ML.  The extensions are as
follows.

\begin{itemize}

\item An extended character set.  Many of the new characters may be
	used in ML identifiers, all may be used in strings.

\item Keywords enclosed in percent `{\tt\%}' signs may be used as
	equivalents for any of the extended characters.  Additional
	keywords are supported to provide access to many of the
	characters supported by \LaTeX{} to give flexibility in the
	form of a documents printed output.

\item Standard~ML programs may be read as extended Standard~ML {\em
	provided\/} all percent `{\tt\%}' signs in the original program
	are replaced by two adjacent percent signs.

\item Other languages may be embedded in the extended Standard~ML text,
	their text is surrounded by the appropriate language embedding
	symbols (i.e., by the extended characters or their equivalent
	keywords).

\end{itemize}

\section{BASIC READER WRITER}

The basic reader writer offers a small number of interfaces, basically
those for directing the ICL~HOL system to its source text.  Additional
interfaces are provided in structure $ReaderWriterSupport$ for embedding
additional languages.

Several error messages are provided to report faults in the user's
textual input to the ICL HOL system, they may be produced from all of
the routines $use\-\_file$, $use\-\_string$ and $use\-\_terminal$.  Some error
messages might be associated with particular routines in the
$ReaderWriterSupport$ structure but that is incidental
to most users, so they are all gathered here.
=ENDDOC

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Primary User Interface} \label{PrimaryUserInterface}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
val Ûuse_fileÝ : string -> unit;
val Ûuse_file1Ý : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
Both of these functions compile and execute {\ProductML} (i.e., Standard ML
extended to allow mathematical symbols)  from the named file.
If the file does not exist then the it will read the file with the
given name and suffix ``{\tt.ML}'', if that file does not exist it will
try the suffix ``{\tt.sml}''.

{\it use\_file} passes the file name string through {\it translate\_for\_output} before using it
as an operating system file name which is appropriate for file names given as {\ProductML} strings.
The variant {\it use\_file1} uses the string exactly as given.
=SEEALSO
Error messages given with signature for $ReaderWriter$.
Flag $use\-\_file_non_stop_mode$.
=FAILURE
5009	Cannot read file `?0` or `?0.ML` or `?0.sml`
=ENDDOC


These messages are written to the standard output by $use\-\_file$ after
errors are detected, they show where the error occured within the text
read.  After message 5502 is produced $use\-\_file$ continues reading the
input file.  After the other messages $use\-\_file$ stops reading and
returns to its caller.

=FAILURE
5501	DESIGN ERROR Character `?0` read too often, abandoning
	file ?1 at character number ?2
5502	Exception ?0 handled by use_file at line ?1 when in `non_stop_mode`
5503	Exception ?0 raised abandoning file ?1 at line ?2
=TEX

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
val Ûuse_stringÝ : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
Read Standard~ML with extended characters allowed, from the given string.
=SEEALSO
Error messages given with signature for $ReaderWriter$.
=ENDDOC

These messages are written to the standard output by $use\-\_string$ after
errors are detected, they show where the error occured within the text
read.  After these messages are produced $use\-\_string$ stops reading and
returns to its caller.

=FAILURE
5511	DESIGN ERROR Character `?0` read too often, abandoning
	string at character number ?1
5512	Exception ?0 raised; abandoning string at character number ?1
=TEX

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
val Ûuse_terminalÝ : unit -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
Read Standard~ML with extended characters allowed, from the terminal.
This routine takes over the terminal, it handles all exceptions as the
outermost level of the ML system.  To return to the default PolyML
terminal reader use $abandon_reader_writer$.

This routine prompts to the conventions of PolyML but uses the strings
``{\tt:>~}'' and ``{\tt:\#~}'', the PolyML prompts do not have the
colon.
These strings are held as the string controls `$prompt1$' and
`$prompt2$' and thus may be altered.

Typing two control-D characters to the terminal prompt,
or reading the end-of-file, causes the function
$PolyML.quit$ to be called.
=SEEALSO
Error messages given with signature for $ReaderWriter$.
Control strings`$prompt1$' and `$prompt2$'.
=ENDDOC

These messages are written to the standard output by $use\-\_terminal$
after errors are detected.  Messages 5523 and 5525 are produced when
$use\-\_terminal$ stops reading the input, it then returns to its caller.
The other messages are status reports about the processing of some
input text, after producing them $use\-\_terminal$ continues reading
from the terminal.

=FAILURE
5522	Exception ?0 ?1 raised
5523	End of input to use_terminal.  Quit.
5524	DESIGN ERROR Character `?0` read too often, abandoning current input
5525	Abandoning reader writer
5526	Exception ?0 raised
=TEX
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
(* Ûprompt1Ý  - boolean flag declared by new_flag, default: ":>" *)
(* Ûprompt2Ý  - boolean flag declared by new_flag, default: ":#" *)
=DESCRIBE
Prompt strings for $use\-\_terminal$.  {} String $prompt1$ is used when the
reader writer is expecting the first line of a top-level expression,
$prompt2$ is used for subsequent lines.  The strings used here must
comprise characters whose decimal codes are in the range~32 to~126
inclusive, but excluding the characters~`{\tt Q}' (i.e., code~81)
and~`{\tt\%}'~(37).
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
val Ûabandon_reader_writerÝ : unit -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
Only meaningfully used after $use\-\_terminal$ has been called, when it
forces an exit from that routine.
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
val Ûreset_use_terminalÝ : unit -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
Restores the state that controls $use_terminal$ to its default values.
N.b., this bypasses the check that $use_terminal$ makes on
recursive calls (and so could cause a small memory leak if
not used with care).
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
(* Ûuse_file_non_stop_modeÝ  - boolean flag declared by new_flag, default: false *)
=DESCRIBE
Makes $use\-\_file$ continue reading text (if the flag is $true$) or stop
reading (if $false$) from the file after an error is reported by PolyML,
this includes both syntax and execution errors.  Default
is to stop reading.
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
val Ûask_at_terminalÝ : string -> string;
=DESCRIBE
Asks a question at the terminal by writing out the given string then
reading a single line of text which is returned.  Characters are read
until a newline or end of file is reached, in the first case the
the returned string will end with a newline.

Any characters in the type ahead buffer of the terminal input stream
before $ask_at_terminal$ is called
are read and saved (for later analysis by the normal reading functions)
before the prompt is output and the response is read.
=FAILURE
5012	Function `use_terminal` is not active
5013	Input stream is not a terminal, nothing read
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

The above function uses the PolyML function $ExtendedIO.can_input$ to
determine how many characters are available in the type ahead buffer,
they are read.  It next outputs the prompt, and finally makes a single
call of $ExtendedIO.input_line$.

\bigskip

Strings produced by, for example, converting parts of HOL terms into
textual form may contain keywords that should be converted into other
forms, in some cases these keywords may be wrapped in double letter
`{\tt QQ}'' characters, see~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF002} for an
explanation.  Translation is automatically performed by the reader
writer for all text that the PolyML system writes to the standard
output.  Text written by $BasicIO.output$ to the standard output is not
converted --- this is because of how PolyML controls its output
streams.  Function $translate_for_output$ performs the conversions.  It
is forgiving with its processing: unknown keywords are left in their
keyword form; unexpected letter `{\tt Q}'s are converted to an
equivalent keyword, namely `{\tt\%Q\%}'; escape sequences used in
Standard~ML strings are echoed literally if they are malformed.

A forgiving behaviour is appropriate given the expected context of use
of the function.  The ICL~HOL system or the user has created some text
to be output.  The text is often the display of a top-level binding,
frequently it indicates some change in the state of the Standard~ML
bindings.  It is appropriate to show as much as possible of these
changes to the user even if occasionally the results contain a few
unconverted characters.

=DOC
val Ûtranslate_for_outputÝ : string -> string;
=DESCRIBE
Translates a string according to the macro processing rules used when
outputting text.  The output produced depends on the setting of the
control flag $use_extended_chars$, when false the result will have no
extended characters, the keyword forms will be used.
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
(* Ûuse_extended_charsÝ  - boolean flag declared by new_flag, default: true *)
=DESCRIBE
Controls how the writer changes the text output from the PolyML
compiler.  When $true$ extended characters are written, when $false$
the corresponding keywords are written.
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
val Ûget_use_extended_chars_flagÝ : unit -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
This function gives the value of the flag {\em use\_extended\_chars}.
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
val Ûdiag_stringÝ : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$diag\_string$ outputs
a string on the standard output stream,
after translating it with
$translate\-\_for\-\_output$(q.v.).
If the string exceeds the value of {\em get\_line\_length} it attempts to split the string into tokens, to fit within the line length.
A token is taken to be an initial string of spaces, followed by exclusively non-space characters.
=SEEALSO
$list\_diag\_string$, $diag\_line$, $raw\_diag\_string$.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûlist_diag_stringÝ : string list -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$list\_diag\_string$ outputs a list of strings
onto the standard output stream,
after translating them with
$translate\-\_for\-\_output$(q.v.). The strings in the list
are concatenated (with spaces to separate them) and then
output with $diag\_string$ (q.v).
=SEEALSO
$diag\_string$, $diag\_line$, $list\_raw\_diag\_string$.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûdiag_lineÝ : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$diag\_line$ outputs a string to the standard output
stream followed by a new line,
after translating it with
$translate\-\_for\-\_output$(q.v.).
It is intended for use in printing formatted terms,
theorems and the like (for which the pretty printer
will have included new lines within the string if
necessary).

\section{SUPPORTING OTHER LANGUAGES}

A large part of the reader writer interface allows the embedding
of other languages.

The style of the interface is to be documented
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR008}, most of the required information is
contained within this document and the implementation
document~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP005}, but it is too bulky to be placed in
this document.  The descriptions that follow assume that such a
description has been seen by the reader of this document.

Many routines have an argument of type $READER_ENV$ which provides the
functions to read characters from the current input stream.  This
argument is not detailed with each function, but a reference to the
type declaration is made.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
signature ÛReaderWriterSupportÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
A set of declarations that allows the addition of new embedded
languages.  The HOL language is an example of a language embedded into
a basic system that understands Standard~ML with extended characters and
percent keywords.
=ENDDOC

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Diagnostic Support}

Reader functions should avoid producing fault messages, where possible
they should be left to the language recogniser to report.  Some faults
can only be reported by reader functions, for these cases the following
functions are available.

In general a fault is reported by calling either $local_error$ or
$local_warn$ and adding details of the error code to the text produced
and continuing.  In the macro processing analogy a short fault report
is written into the macro processor's output at the place of detection
of an error.  Functions $add_error_code$ and $add_error_codes$ are
provided to give a uniform style for these short reports.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
val Ûlocal_errorÝ : string -> int -> (unit -> string) list -> unit;
val Ûlocal_warnÝ : string -> int -> (unit -> string) list -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
An error or warning message is written to the standard output, then the
function returns.  The arguments are identical in form to functions
$error$ and $fail$ of {\tt DS/FMU/IED/DTD002}.
=SEEALSO
Functions $error$ and $fail$.
=ENDDOC

These messages are used by $local_error$ and $local_warn$ for the
text they output.

=FAILURE
5531	*** WARNING ?0 from ?1: ?2
5532	*** ERROR ?0 from ?1: ?2
=TEX

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
val Ûadd_error_codeÝ : int * string list -> string list;
val Ûadd_error_codesÝ : int list * string list -> string list;
=DESCRIBE
For each error number ``$nn$'' given as the first argument an
entry of the form ``\verb*| ERROR__|$nn$\verb*| |'' is added
to the head of the second argument.
(Note that~``\verb*| |'' denotes aspace character.)
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

Diagnostic control $RW_diagnostics$ is interpreted as a series of
`bits'  each controlling some diagnostic output which is written to the
PolyML standard output.  A zero value indicates no diagnostics.  The
value is selected by adding numbers from the following table according
to the diagnostic outputs required.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{crp{4in}}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{Value}&	Information Output\\
$2^0$&$1$&	Text passed to PolyML.\\
$2^1$&$2$&        Text passed to PolyML, but showing the list structure
		passed by routines such as $get_ML_any$.\\
$2^2$&$4$&	Characters as they are read.\\
$2^3$&$8$&	Text passed to the writer function before any
		translation is performed.\\
$2^4$&$16$&	Prevents text from being translated before output by the
		writer function.\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

=DOC
(* ÛRW_diagnosticsÝ  - integer control declared by new_int_control, default: 0 *)
=DESCRIBE
For reader writer diagnostic purposes.
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Character Input --- Part 1}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
type ÛREADER_ENVÝ (* = {
	ÛadvanceÝ			: unit -> string,
	Ûlook_at_nextÝ			: unit -> string,
	Ûpush_backÝ			: string -> unit
} *) ;
val Ûskip_and_look_at_nextÝ : READER_ENV -> unit -> string;
=DESCRIBE
All of the parsing functions in the reader writer support use the
functions provided in this record type to read characters from the
current input stream.  Attempting to read characters by any other
method will have unpredictable results.
The utility function $skip\_and\_look\_at\_next$ combines
$advance $ and $look\_at\_next$ discarding the result of $advance$.
Some applications will want to use instances of this data type
to count line numbers, so pushing back newlines that have not
been read is not advisable.
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
exception ÛTooManyReadEmptiesÝ;
=DESCRIBE
Associated with the reader functions is the exception $TooManyReadEmpties$
which is raised when the parser has read the end of the file and
has passed the end of file character at least 100 times to the compiler.
Raising this exception signifies something has gone wrong in a reader.
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Data Base of Keywords and Extended Characters}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
structure ÛPrettyNamesÝ : sig
=DESCRIBE
A structure within $ReaderWriterSupport$ that gathers all the
information relating the extended characters and percent keywords
understood by the system, together with the interfaces for
interrogating and extending the information.
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
	datatype ÛNAME_CLASSÝ
		=	ÛSimpleÝ
		|	ÛStartingÝ	of (READER_ENV -> (string * bool)
						-> string -> bool -> string list
						-> string list) * string
		|	ÛMiddleÝ	of string
		|	ÛEndingÝ	of string
		|	ÛIgnoreÝ
		|	ÛInvalidÝ;
=DESCRIBE
These detail the characteristics of a symbol.  $Simple$ is used for
symbols that may be part of identifiers.  $Starting$, $Middle$ and $Ending$
relate to the symbols position when embedding text of other languages.
The function with $Starting$ is the reader routine for
the particular embedded language.  Details of how this function should be
written (and of it arguments) are given in the implementation document
corresponding to this
design.  $Ignore$ is used for characters that are completely ignored in the
input, the extended characters for indexing come in this category.  $Invalid$
will cause an error message.
=SEEALSO
Error 5007
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
	type ÛPRETTY_NAMEÝ (* = ( string list * string OPT * NAME_CLASS )  *)  ;
=DESCRIBE
Each symbol is defined in a three-element tuple of this type.  Elements
of the tuple are as follows.  First, a non-empty list of the keywords
that may be used for this symbol.  These keywords exclude
the enclosing percent signs.  Second, an optional character
for the symbol.  Third, a value of datatype $NAME_CLASS$ indicating
the characteristics of the symbol.

The extended character field, when used, contains a single character.
It may be the letter ``{\tt Q}'' or any character
with decimal code greater than 127.
=SEEALSO
Function $add_new_symbols$, for details of the validation of values
of this type.
=EXAMPLE
	([	"fn",
		"lambda"],	Value "Ì",			Simple),

Some character sequences may occur in many contexts in the input text,
for these a higher level of input than simple characters is
appropriate.  These character sequences are primarily inspired by
needing to read keywords enclosed in percent signs.

Data type $SYMBOL$ gives the various sequences that may be read.
Keywords and extended characters that have been declared via
$add_new_symbols$ are returned with constructor $SymKnown$, the string
hold the keyword (without the enclosing percents) or the extended
character read, the boolean being $true$ for a keyword and %false$for
an extended character.

=DESCRIBE
Assemble a string literal and add it to the left hand context given in the
second argument.  On entry the opening string quote has been read, exit
when the closing string quote has been read.  The goal of this routine
is to form an equivalent string that can be read by a Standard~ML
compiler, and to defer as much validation of the string as possible to
that compiler.  Minimal validation is performed on escape sequences.
Well-formed layout sequences (i.e., the sequence ``{\hbox{\verb|\|{\em
f..f\/}\verb|\|}}'') are
removed, characters not recognised as formatting ones are retained and
wrapped between ``\verb|\ |'' and ``\verb| \|'' for later checking by
the Standard~ML compiler.  Extended characters are translated to their
three digit decimal form.

Function $get_ML_string$ reads a Standard~ML string.

Function $get_primed_string$ reads a string enclosed with single
left-hand primes~(~{\tt`}~).  These are similar to Standard~ML strings
but with the meanings of the single~(~{\tt`}~) and
double~(~{\tt"}~) prime characters interchanged.

An end of file found in the string indicates that there is no more
input available, and so an immediate failure (error 5002) is raised.
Error code 5014 is included to aid in understanding where errors occur,
this error is not actually generated until the first non white-space
character after the newline is processed.
All other errors detected in strings are reported when found,
additionally their numbers passed back in the result.
=FAILURE

The syntax of Standard~ML strings is defined
in~\cite[section~2.2, page~3]{Milner90}.

Note that error code 5014 could be deferred for detection and reporting
by the Standard~ML compiler but the PolyML compiler's error messages is
not very helpful in this case.  The delay in its production is due to
how function $read_symbol$ gathers white-space characters.

\subsection{Embedding Other Languages}

Other languages may be embedded in various ways, they are called
``general'', ``specific'' and ``named'' quotations.  Language texts
(that is, quotations in a language) are introduced and completed by
keyword or their corresponding extended character.

Embedding other languages is achieved by providing a reader for the new
language, then making it and its enclosing symbols known to the
language embedding mechanisms.

General quotations are for expressions, such as HOL terms, that may be
used as parts of larger expressions.  These may use
the keywords ``{\tt\%<\%}'' and ``{\tt\%>\%}'' (or the corresponding
extended characters) to enclose the embedded text, the language is
indicated by the characters immediately following the opening keyword.
The BNF syntax, see~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN009}, of general quotations is
as follows.
General quotations may also use other introductory symbols.

=GFTSHOW BNF
quotation	=	start_symbol, [ language_code ], quoted_text, '%>%';

start_symbol	=	'%<%'	(* For HOL terms *)
		|	'%<:%'	(* For HOL types *)
		|	other_start_symbols ;

language_code	=	'%dntext%', name, '%cantext%'
		|	':' ;
=TEX

Where:

\begin{description}

\item[$name$ ] is an identifier in the extended Standard~ML.

\item[$white_space$ ] is a space or a tab character.

\item[$quoted_text$ ] is text in the named language.

\item[$other_start_symbols$ ] are extended character of keywords of type
	$Starting$.

\end{description}

The combination of $start_symbols$ and $name$ identifies the quoted
language.  The default quotation with ``{\tt\%<\%}''
where the $language_code$ is not given, is of a HOL term, which may
also be indicated by a name of ``{\tt HOL}''.  The colon form is
equivalent to using the name ``{\tt HOL:}''.

Conventionally, languages which yield HOL types should have a colon as
the last character of their name.

Note that including any space or tab characters before the
$language_code$ will cause the default interpretation, namely as a HOL term.
Note also that the keywords ``{\tt\%<\%\%dntext\%}'' (or their extended
characters) indicate the start of a language code regardless of what
characters follow.  Thus it is an error if the $name$ and
``{\tt\%cantext\%}'' are absent.

\bigskip

``Specific quotations'' are intended for use at the ML top-level rather
than in expressions.  They have individual keywords and corresponding
extended characters to enclose their text, for example a Z~schema
definition would\footnote{This facility is needed for the Z in HOL work
and these are the proposed symbols.} be enclosed by the
characters~``\StartZSchema'' and~``\EndZBox''.

\bigskip

``Named quotations'' are also intended for use at the ML top-level
rather than in expressions.  They have an initial keyword or characters
which is immediately followed by a language name to start their text,
they have a common ending keyword or characters, for example a HOL
labelled product definition is enclosed by  ``{\tt\StartFormal
HOLLabProd}'' and ``{\tt\EndFormal}''.

trailing ``{\tt\%cantext\%}'', the default language and type are expanded to
give their full names, namely ``{\tt HOL}'' or ``{\tt HOL:}'' for the
colon form.  The third string is text to be included at the start of
the quoted text, in the case of a HOL quotation it is the first
characters that are to be read by the HOL recogniser.  The string list
is the left hand context of the call and must be returned with the text

All characters are considered significant.  The routine is designed to
assist in error recovery by consuming the text of large quotations
rather than stopping reading at the first detected problem.  Thus the

\section{TEST STRATEGY}

There are three main test areas for the reader writer.

\begin{itemize}

\item Reasonable behaviour.  Does the reader writer do the correct task
	most of the time, does it allow the compiling and execution of
	programs written in enhanced Standard~ML.

\item Correct processing.  Are the input and output streams correctly
	manipulated and passed on to or received from from the PolyML system?

\item Functional interfaces.  Do the functional interfaces do the
	correct task?

\end{itemize}

These areas are distinguished by the sort of testing that is sensible to
do.  Many aspects of the first two could probably be tested using the
module test harness~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD013}, but doing so would
involve excessive work and would result in opaque test scripts.

Reasonable behaviour is determined by actually using the reader writer
during the compilation of much of the ICL~HOL system.  This is
because it is written using the extended Standard~ML supported by the
reader writer.  If the modules of the ICL~HOL system compile
successfully producing the correct signatures then a large portion of
the reader writer must be executing reasonably and properly.  The
reader writer is similarly needed during the development of other
modules, its reasonable behaviour is indicated by how it supports the
development activity in the context of error detection and recovery.

Thus, tests for reasonable behaviour are:

\begin{itemize}

\item Compilation and execution of much of the ICL~HOL system.

\item Compilation and execution of module tests of the reader writer
	and the rest of the ICL~HOL system.

\end{itemize}

Correct processing concerns the manipulation of text that is to be
passed to the read phase of the (conventional) read-evaluate-print
cycle of the PolyML system, followed by the manipulation of system
outputs.  In this context much of the reader writer deals with text
that may not successfully parse as Standard~ML: the reader writer is
required to behave itself in the presence of any text the user presents
and to either report the problems itself or to pass the problem onto
the PolyML compiler for it to report.  The reader writer works by side
effect on the input output streams and via an interface to the
read-evaluate-print cycle of the PolyML system.  Accordingly the reader
writer deals with text that cannot easily be tested using the
facilities of the module test harness~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD013}.

Tests for correct processing are part of integration testing of
the ICL~HOL system, they include demonstrating that the
following cases are correctly handled on both input and output.
Much of the input processing can be tested with function
$use\-\_string$ under control of the module test
harness~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD013}.

\begin{itemize}

\item Strings.  Empty strings.  Escape sequences: ignored white space,
	newline characters, decimal codes, control (caret
	``{\verb|^|}'') codes.  Extended characters.  Percent
	``{\tt\%}'' characters.  Percent keywords.

\item Simple Standard~ML expressions.

\item Extended characters.  Use of equivalent keywords.  Use in
	extended Standard~ML identifiers.

\item Quotations.  Comments strings and character literals.  Nested
	quotations.  Quotations of Standard~ML.  Quotations of unknown
	languages.  Term and type quotations.  Declarative quotations,
	i.e., with schema boxes and similar.

\item Malformed variants of most of the preceding items.

\end{itemize}

Parts of the reader writer may be tested with the module test
harness~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD013} and a module test document is
used for these.  Note that successful execution of the module tests
also demonstrates both reasonable behaviour and correct processing.
Functions with an argument of type $READER_ENV$ cannot easily be
tested here since they work by side effect upon that argument.
The tests cover the following.

\begin{itemize}

\item $use\-\_string$.

\item Comments.  Nested comments.  Comments containing asterisks.

\item Function $translate_for_output$ with both settings of control
	flag $use_extended_chars$.

{\sloppy\hbadness 1500
\item Simple functions from structure $ReaderWriterSupport$, namely:
	$local_error$, $local_warn$, $add_error_code$,
	$add_error_codes$, $is_special_char$, $string_of_int3$, and
	$to_ML_string$.

}%

\item Accessing extended characters and keywords from structure
	$PrettyNames$:  accessing predefined symbols by character and
	by keyword; adding and accessing some new symbols; unknown

\item The following functions from structure $ReaderWriterSupport$ can
	be invoked but cannot be easily tested for their correct side
	effects:  $add_general_reader$, $add_specific_reader$,
	$look_up_general_reader$, and $look_up_specific_reader$.

\end{itemize}

Areas of the reader writer that cannot be tested by the module test
harness~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD013} are as follows.

\begin{itemize}

\item Functions that take a value of type $READER_ENV$ as an argument
	and return a string line.  These functions are all tested
	indirectly mostly by other parts of the reader writer module
	tests --- if these functions were not working then the tests
	would not even compile.

	These functions include:
		get_percent_name
		read_symbol
		skip_comment
		get_ML_string
		get_primed_string
		get_box_braces
		get_curly_braces
		get_round_braces
		get_ML_any
		general_quotation
		specific_quotation
		named_quotation
		get_HOL_any
		HOL_reader
		HOL_lab_prod_reader
=TEX
	These cannot be tested explicitly.  The test policy in
	file "dtd005.doc" explains much of this but it could be
	enhanced to name these functions and give a clearer reason.

\item Functions that can only be tested during integration tests since
	any test rely on users typing at keyboards and observing what
	happens.

=IGN
	These functions include:
		use_terminal
		abandon_reader_writer
		ask_at_terminal
=TEX
