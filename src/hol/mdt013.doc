\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}

This document comprises test cases and test code/data for
testing the module test harness specified in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD013}.

\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Background and Purpose}

This document contains the test code and test data for
testing the module test harness. Most of the implementation
of the ICL HOL product will be tested by tests written
for use with the module test harness described in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD013}. It is essential therefore that the
test harness itself correctly highlights faults and
errors in the product implementation and reports them
in a manner which helps the developer quickly identify
where the error is occurring, and how to reproduce the error.
The harness could be used to test itself. This approach
would be dubious. It would be easy to construct a
harness which always returned true whether or not the harness
worked. This harness if used to test itself would indicate that
it works, when in fact it did nothing of the sort.

The aim of these tests is to demonstrate that the functions
contained within the test harness operate according to
specification, by using mechanisms as independent to the
way the harness is implemented as possible.
For example, where the harness might use a ref pointer
to store a cumulative register of the results so far produced,
the tests here would for example use recursion to store
the results (i.e. on the stack), in order to
demonstrate the correct functionality. The organisation of
these tests is inevitably not as evident as in test documents
which use the harness. This is a consequence of not using
the harness, and also indicates the sort of benefit resulting
from the harness's use in other circumstances.

A variable mdt013 is used to accumulate test results throughout
the running of the tests in this document. It contains
a list of test case - boolean pairs, indicating which
test cases passed and which failed. The list is constructed
manually as the test progress, and its value at the
end of the tests should be inspected to see the
success or failure of each of the tests carried out.

=SML
val mdt013 = [];
=TEX

\subsubsection{Dependencies}

These tests demonstrates the correctness (or otherwise) of
the test harness as implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP013}, and
its corresponding detailed design document, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD013}.

\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}

Futher tests will need to be produced on occassion that
the test harness is extended in some way.

\subsubsection{Deficiencies}

There are no known deficiencies.

\section{TEST CASES}

\begin{description}

\item[ModuleTest.1]
Test that {\it init\_mt\_results} correctly initialises the
results store to an empty list.

\item[ModuleTest.2]
Test that {\it store\_mt\_results} correctly stores results and that
those results match those printed by the function {\it get\_mt\_results}.

\item[ModuleTest.3]
Test that {\it store\_mt\_results\_show} returns the
expected results when executed, and that the results are
appended to the results store correctly (by using the
function {\it get\_mt\_results}).

\item[ModuleTest.4]
Test that {\it summarize\_mt\_results} returns an ``ok'' string if all
the results in the result store record passes, it returns a
string identifying failed cases.

\item[ModuleTest.5]
Test that {\it gen\_fail\_msg} for given parameters correctly
generates a failure message. Ensure that this also works for
string substitution in error messages (as described in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD002}).

\item[ModuleTest.6]
Test that {\it mt\_runf} returns expected outputs when
provided with a) a set of simple testcases, whose expected
results are a different type to that which the functions
within the test cases yield, together with b) a function which
in some way compares the output of a function with the
expected result and returns a boolean value.

\item[ModuleTest.7]
Test that {\it mt\_run} returns expected outputs when
given test cases for known-to-be-correct functions and
some simple data.

\item[ModuleTest.8a]
Test that {\it mt\_run\_fail} records a passed test when a
function raises the exception ``Fail'' and
the message matches that expected.

\item[ModuleTest.8b]
Test that  {\it mt\_run\_fail} records a failure when
a function raises the exception ``Error''.

\item[ModuleTest.8c]
Test that  {\it mt\_run\_fail} records a failure when
a function does not raise an exception.

\item[ModuleTest.9a]
Test that {\it mt\_run\_error} records a passed test when a
function raises the exception ``Error'' and
the message matches that expected.

\item[ModuleTest.9b]
Test that  {\it mt\_run\_error} records a failure when
a function raises the exception ``Fail''.

\item[ModuleTest.9c]
Test that  {\it mt\_run\_error} records a failure when
a function does not raise an exception.

\end{description}


\section{TESTING THE STORING AND PRINTING OF TEST RESULTS}

The files are loaded.
=SML
use_file "dtd013";
use_file "imp013";
=TEX

\subsection{init\_mt\_results}

The testing of the code which stores and prints test
results is difficult without using other parts of the
test harness. The accumulator is not available to
use since it is not present in the signature. We therefore
take the approach that if the storing and printing of results
behaves in an expected way when given particular inputs,
then we believe the functionality to be correct.

First we test that $init\_mt\_results$ clears the area.

=SML
init_mt_results();
val mdt013 = 
	if get_mt_results() = nil
	then ("ModuleTest.1a",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.1a",false)::mdt013;
=TEX

Next we put something into the store, check that something
is in there, and clear it again using init\_mt\_results, and check
that the store has indeed been cleared.

=SML
fun manufac_res x = [("TCASE",true)];
fun manufac_res2 x = [("TCASE2",true)];
store_mt_results manufac_res 0;
val mdt013 = 
	if get_mt_results() = nil
	then ("ModuleTest.1b",false)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.1b",true)::mdt013;
init_mt_results();
val mdt013 = 
	if get_mt_results() = nil
	then ("ModuleTest.1c",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.1c",false)::mdt013;
=TEX

\subsection{store\_mt\_results and get\_mt\_results}

Next we store a known result and print it recording
true if the printed version matches that which we stored.

=SML
store_mt_results manufac_res 0;
val mdt013 = if get_mt_results() = [("TCASE",true)]
	then ("ModuleTest.2a",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.2a",false)::mdt013;
store_mt_results manufac_res 0;
val mdt013 = if get_mt_results() = [("TCASE",true),("TCASE",true)]
	then ("ModuleTest.2b",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.2b",false)::mdt013;
=TEX

\subsection{store\_mt\_results\_show}

We do the same thing but using the store\_mt\_results\_show
function. We check that the output of this function is
correct, and then that it has also correctly stored
the results.

=SML
fun manufac_res1 x = [("TCASE1",false)];
val mdt013 = if store_mt_results_show manufac_res1 0
		= [("TCASE1",false)]
	then ("ModuleTest.3a",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.3a",false)::mdt013;

val mdt013 = if get_mt_results()
		= [("TCASE",true),("TCASE",true),("TCASE1",false)]
	then ("ModuleTest.3b",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.3b",false)::mdt013;
=TEX

\subsection{summarize\_mt\_results}

We now check that summarise results returns the expected
values given a) a list recording that one test failed and
b) a list recording that two tests worked ok.

=SML

val mdt013 = if summarize_mt_results() =
	"++++ Duplicated test identities: TCASE ++++\n\n++++ The following module tests failed: TCASE1 ++++\n\n"
	then ("ModuleTest.4a",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.4a",false)::mdt013;
init_mt_results();
store_mt_results manufac_res 0;
val mdt013 = if get_mt_results() = [("TCASE",true)]
	then ("ModuleTest.4b",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.4b",false)::mdt013;
store_mt_results manufac_res2 0;
val mdt013 = if get_mt_results() = [("TCASE",true),("TCASE2",true)]
	then ("ModuleTest.4c",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.4c",false)::mdt013;
val mdt013 = if summarize_mt_results() =
		"All module tests passed."
	then ("ModuleTest.4d",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.4d",false)::mdt013;
=TEX

\section{TESTING THE GENERATION OF TEST DATA}

There is at present only one function which generates
test data, {\it gen\_fail\_msg}.

\subsection{gen\_fail\_msg}

Here we wish to test the function {\it gen\_fail\_msg}
which will generate a failure/error message string from
its parameters and by consulting the database of error
messages. The first thing we do is to ensure that
we have a message in the database, and that we know what
it is.

=SML
val msgid=1000;
val msgtext = "Module Test Error";
pp'change_error_message {id=msgid, text=msgtext};
=TEX

Next we generate expected output for a fail exception.

=SML
val fail_output = fail "mdt013" msgid []
	handle Fail msg => get_message msg;
=TEX

Now we test that message generated by {\it gen\_fail\_msg}
matches the expected output.

=SML
val mdt013 = 
	if (gen_fail_msg "mdt013" msgid []) = fail_output
	then ("ModuleTest.5a",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.5a",false)::mdt013;
=TEX
We repeat the test once more, but for messages which
involve substitution of strings as described
in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD002}.

=SML
val msgtext = "Module Test Error ?0 ?1 ?2 ?0";
pp'change_error_message {id=msgid, text=msgtext};
val fail_output = fail "mdt013" msgid [(fn () => "arg0"),(fn () => "arg1"),(fn () => "arg2"),
	(fn () => "arg3")]
	handle Fail msg => get_message msg;
=TEX
=SML
val mdt013 =
	if (gen_fail_msg "mdt013" msgid ["arg0","arg1","arg2"])
	= fail_output
	then ("ModuleTest.5b",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.5b",false)::mdt013;

=TEX
Now check for missing arguments:
=SML
val fail_output = fail "mdt013" msgid [(fn () => "arg0"),(fn () => "arg1"),(fn () => "BAD1")]
	handle Fail msg => get_message msg;
=TEX
=SML
val mdt013 =
	if (gen_fail_msg "mdt013" msgid ["arg0","arg1"])
	= fail_output
	then ("ModuleTest.5c",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.5c",false)::mdt013;

=TEX

\section{FUNCTIONS WHICH RUN THE TESTS}

\subsection{mt\_runf}

First we set up a new data type constructed from an int.
We write a function which compares the value of the new type
with an int, and if they are equal, returns true, else returns
false.

=SML
datatype REL = Rel of int;

fun is_eq (i : int, r as Rel n) = i = n;
val r1 = Rel 4;
val r2 = Rel 6;
=TEX

The test data used simply comprises arithmetic functions,
values for input, and expected outputs of a different type.
The aim is to check that {\it mt\_runf} correctly uses
the function {\it is\_eq} to check the result.

=SML
fun testdata ()= [
("ModuleTest.6b",(curry (op + )) 3, 1, r1),
("ModuleTest.6a",(curry (op * )) 2, 3, r2)
];

val mdt013 = (mt_runf is_eq (testdata()))@mdt013;
=TEX


\subsection{mt\_run}

As in the previous test, we use test data which is constructed
out of known-to-work functions, {\it hd} and {\it tl}.

=SML

fun testdata () = [
("TC1",hd, [3,4,5,6], 3),
("TC2",hd, [2,4,6,8,10], 4),
("TC3",(hd o rev), [3,4,5,6], 6),
("TC4",(hd o rev), [2,4,6,8,10], 10)
];
val res = [("TC1", true), ("TC2", false), ("TC3", true), ("TC4", true)];
val mdt013 = if mt_run (testdata ())= res
	then
		("ModuleTest.7a",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.7a",false)::mdt013;
=TEX

\subsection{mt\_run\_fail}

Before carrying out this test, we need to check that
the database of error messages contains at least one message,
and that we know what it is.

=SML
val msgid=1000;
val msgtext = "Module Test Error";
pp'change_error_message {id=msgid, text=msgtext};
=TEX

=SML
fun testdata () = [
("TC1",fail "mdt013" msgid, [], gen_fail_msg "mdt013" msgid []),
("TC2",fail "any" msgid, [], gen_fail_msg "any" msgid [])
];

val res = [("TC1",true),("TC2",true)];
val mdt013 = if mt_run_fail (testdata()) = res
	then
		("ModuleTest.8a",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.8a",false)::mdt013;
=TEX

We jump onto the next test case group briefly, since
the data set up here is suitable.

=SML
val res = [("TC1",false),("TC2",false)];
val mdt013 = if mt_run_error (testdata()) = res
	then
		("ModuleTest.9b",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.9b",false)::mdt013;
=TEX

Finally, we check that if we are expecting a Fail exception
to be raised, and one isn't then an error is recorded.

=SML
fun testdata () = [
("TC1",hd, [3,4,5], gen_fail_msg "mdt013" msgid [])
];

val res = [("TC1",false)];
val mdt013 = if mt_run_fail (testdata()) = res
	then
		("ModuleTest.8c",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.8c",false)::mdt013;
=TEX

\subsection{mt\_run\_error}

We construct test data which when evaluated with raise
Error exceptions.

=SML
fun testdata () = [
("TC1",error "mdt013" msgid, [], gen_fail_msg "mdt013" msgid []),
("TC2",error "any" msgid, [], gen_fail_msg "any" msgid [])
];

val res = [("TC1",true),("TC2",true)];
val mdt013 = if mt_run_error (testdata()) = res
	then
		("ModuleTest.9a",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.9a",false)::mdt013;
=TEX

We jump back to the previous test case group briefly, since
the data set up here is suitable, and we missed it out then.

=SML
val res = [("TC1",false),("TC2",false)];
val mdt013 = if mt_run_fail (testdata()) = res
	then
		("ModuleTest.8b",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.8b",false)::mdt013;
=TEX

Finally, we check that if we are expecting an Error exception
to be raised, and one isn't then an error is recorded.

=SML
fun testdata () = [
("TC1",hd, [3,4,5], gen_fail_msg "mdt013" msgid [])
];

val res = [("TC1",false)];
val mdt013 = if mt_run_error (testdata()) = res
	then
		("ModuleTest.9c",true)::mdt013
	else
		("ModuleTest.9c",false)::mdt013;
=TEX

Finally, we summarize the results manually.

=SML
fun all_ran nil = true
  | all_ran ((a,b)::xs) = (
	if b = false
	then
		false
	else
		all_ran xs);

val mdt013 = rev mdt013;
val mdt013_summary = all_ran mdt013;
=TEX

If the value of {\it mdt013\_summary} is true, then
the module test harness has passed its module tests.

Now let's fake all the above into a sequence of conventional module tests:
=SML
init_mt_results();
store_mt_results Combinators.I mdt013;
diag_string(summarize_mt_results());
=TEX
