\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains the detailed design of part of the \ProductZ\ system.
The document responds to \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD016}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
The purpose of this document is to provide facilities for the integers in Z analogous to those for the integers in HOL as described in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD093}.
The main facilities are a conversion to put arithmetic expressions into a normal form and a decision procedure for zero-order linear arithmetic.

For simplicity of implementation, the facilities are provided by an interface to those for HOL.
This enables much better re-use of existing material than would be possible in a direct implementation (because the arithmetic

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This document depends on the theory $z\_numbers$ defined in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD086}, on the conversions and other tools in  \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD105}.

\subsubsection{Algorithms}
For simplicity of implementation, the facilities are provided by an interface to those for HOL.
This enables much better re-use of existing material than would be possible in a direct implementation (at heart, because the generic support for arithmetic normalisation in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD081} deals with curried HOL functions and adjusting it to work with Z infix operators would involve a relatively large amount of custom re-coding or interfacing).

For the arithmetic normalisation, the main interface here uses the HOL conversion and then converts back to Z.
As the linear arithmetic prover is a prove-or-fail black box, most users will be not need any understanding of the conversion to HOL behind the scenes.


\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
Several additions could be made.
E.g., more interfaces for the tactic programmer (e.g., see $and\_conv1$ in the implementation.

\subsection{Conversion of Z Arithmetic to HOL Arithmetic}

=DOC
	val Ûz_ú_convÝ : CONV;
	val Ûú_z_convÝ : CONV;
=DESCRIBE
In the theory $z\_arithmetic\_tools$, isomorphisms, $z\_ú$ and $ú\_z$, are defined between the Z integers and the HOL integers.
These may be used to translate an arithmetic problem in Z into one in HOL.
These conversions implement this translation and its inverse.

The operators handled by the conversions are
=INLINEFT
+, *, ~
=TEX
\ and $-$.

The translation to HOL is carried out according to the following scheme:

=GFT
z_úñt1 + t2®	­	¬z_ú t1 + z_ú  t2®
z_úñt1 * t2®	­	¬z_ú t1 * z_ú  t2®
z_úñ~t1®	­	¬~ z_ú t1®
z_úñú_z t1®	­	¬t1®
z_úñZ'Int c®	­	¬îú c®
=TEX

$z\_ú\_conv$ implements the above scheme recursively to translate the
result of applying $z\_ú$ to a Z arithmetic expression into HOL.

$ú\_z\_conv$ is the analogue of $z\_ú\_conv$, performing the translation of $ú\_z$ applied to a HOL integer arithmetic expression into Z.

\subsection{Arithmetic Normalisation}

z_anf_conv
=TEX
\ is a conversion which proves theorems of the form
=INLINEFT
ô t1 = t2

$t2$ is in what we may call additive normal form, i.e. it has the form:
=INLINEFT

, where the
=INLINEFT
t‰i
=TEX
\ have the form
=INLINEFT
s‰1 * s‰2 * ...

where the
=INLINEFT

\ are atoms.
Here, by atom
we mean an expression which is not of the form
=INLINEFT
t‰1 + t‰2 + ...
=TEX
or
=INLINEFT
s‰1 * s‰2 * ...
=TEX
.

The summands
=INLINEFT
t‰i
=TEX
\ and,
within them,
the factors
=INLINEFT
s‰j
=TEX
\ are given in increasing order with respect to the ordering
on terms analogous to that given by the function
=INLINEFT
z_term_order
=TEX
, q.v. Arithmetic computation is carried out on atoms to ensure
that at most one of the summands is a numeric literal and that, within
each summand, at most one factor is a numeric literal. Any literal appears
at the beginning of its factor or summand and addition of $0$
or multiplication by $1$ is simplified out.
Any signs are moved to the first factor in each summand.

The conversion fails with error number 106010 if there no changes can be
made to the term.

\section{PROOF CONTEXTS}
=DOC
(* Proof Context: Ûz_lin_arithÝ *)
(* Proof Context: Ûz_lin_arith1Ý *)
=DESCRIBE
``$z\_lin\_arith$'' is a proof context whose main purpose is to supply a decision procedure
for problems in linear arithmetic in Z.
``$z\_lin\_arith1$''  differs from it only by using ``$'z\_numbers1$''.
The proof context provides an interface to the proof context $'ú\_lin\_arith$ which provides the analogous facilities for the HOL integers.
\paragraph{Contents}
The proof context is the result of merging $z\_predicates$, $'z\_numbers(1)$ and $'z\_lin\_arith$.

\paragraph{Examples}
=INLINEFT
PC_T1"z_lin_arith"prove_tac[]
=TEX
\ will prove any of the following goals:
=GFT
	([], ñµa, b, c:ú·a ¼ b ± (a + b < c + a) ´ a < c®)
	([], ñµa, b, c:ú·a ¾ b ± ³ b < c ´ a ¾ c®)
	([], ñµa, b, c:ú·a + 2*b < 2*a ´ b + b < a®)
	([], ñµ x, y:ú· ³ (2*x + y = 4 ± 4*x + 2*y = 7)®)
=TEX

In the following example, an induction reduces the problem to linear
arithmetic, and then the automatic proof tactic in $z\_lin\_arith$
completes the proof.
=GFT
set_goal([], ñµb:î·(b + 1)*(b + 1) > 0®);
a(PC_T1 "z_library" REPEAT strip_tac);
a( z_¼_induction_tacñb® THEN PC_T1 "z_lin_arith" asm_prove_tac[]);
pop_thm();
=TEX
=SEEALSO
=INLINEFT
'z_lin_arith
=FAILUREC
\paragraph{Errors}
The errors reported by the automatic proof tactic are as for $'ú\_lin\_arith$.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
(* Proof Context: Û'z_lin_arithÝ *)
(* Proof Context: Û'z_lin_arith1Ý *)
=DESCRIBE
``$'z\_lin\_arith$'' is a component proof context whose purpose is to supply a decision procedure
for problems in linear arithmetic for the integers in Z.
``$'z\_lin\_arith1$'' i a copy, only differing in using ``$'z_numbers1$''.
\paragraph{Contents}
The rewriting, theorem stripping and conclusion stripping components
are those from $'z_numbers$ augmented with the following
transformations:
=GFT
ñ(a º ú) = b®		­	ña ¼ b ± b ¼ a®
ña ¼ b®		­	¬‘TRY_C z_ú_conv ¬z_ú a®® ¼ ‘TRY_C z_ú_conv ¬b®®®
ña < b®		­	¬‘TRY_C z_ú_conv ¬a®® < ‘TRY_C z_ú_conv ¬b®®®
ñx  î®		­	¬0 ¼ x®
=TEX
(where all variables are of type ú).
The effect of the above scheme is to transformed any Z equation or inequality in ¼ or $<$ into an equivalent inequality over the HOL integers.
The automatic proof procedures for the proof context are (slight adaptations of) the ones in the proof context $ú\_lin\_arith$, which can then automatically prove the transformed form if it is a theorem of linear arithmetic.

The automatic proof components is an interface to the one for $'ú\_lin\_arith$.
Other components are as for $'z\_numbers$.

\paragraph{Examples}
A typical use of the proof context would be to solve problems containing
a mixture of (linear) arithmetic and set theory.

For example,
=INLINEFT
MERGE_PCS_T1["z_sets_ext", "'z_lin_arith"]prove_tac[]
=TEX
will prove any of the following goals:
=GFT
	([], ñµm:ú· {i:ú | m ¼ i ± i < m+3} = {m, m+1, m+2}®)
	([], ñ{i, j : ú | 30*i = 105*j} = {i, j : ú | 2*i = 7*j}®)
	([], ñ{i : ú | 5*i = 6*i} = {0}®)
=SEEALSO

\paragraph{Errors}
The errors reported by the automatic proof tactic are as for $'ú\_lin\_arith$.
