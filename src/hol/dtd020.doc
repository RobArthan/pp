\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains the detailed design for the symbol table module for ICL HOL.
The high level design for this material is given in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD008}.
Some of what is specified here implements facilities required explicitly in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF001}.
\subsection{Introduction}
In order to give the parser, type inferrer and pretty printer a uniform
interface to determine the properties of identifiers we have a symbol table
module which, in effect, supplies a mapping of identifiers onto
records encoding the properties of interest. The symbol table module
also contains the interfaces whereby the user sets certain properties of
identifiers (namely the interfaces for fixity, terminator, binder and type
abbreviation declarations).

One of the more important objectives of the symbol table is to protect
modules it serves from needing to be aware of context changes, including
updates to the current theory as well as navigation around the current
theory.

\subsection{Purpose and Background}
See \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD008}.
\subsection{Dependencies}
The symbol table module is dependent on the interface to the
abstract data type $THM$, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD012}
and on the lexical analyser module, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD015}.
\subsection{Possible Enhancements}
A function for finding the best possible abbreviation for a type (in some
sense to be decided) could be provided and would support a nicer pretty printing
option in a future release.
\subsection{Deficiencies}
None known.
\section{DISCUSSION}

\subsection{General Principles}
The following general principles are followed (and should be respected by
maintainers and enhancers):

\begin{enumerate}
\item
The symbol table reflects a current context determined by the current theory.
All updates affect the current theory.
\item
All special properties of an identifier in one context can be suppressed
in any descendant context. This sometimes requires the use of undeclaration
records in the underlying $USER\_DATA$ value which is stored in the theory.
\item
The validity of identifiers is only checked when it is necessary to avoid
the user tying himself in serious knots (e.g. by declaring a space character
as a terminator).
Such things as infixes, type abbreviations etc. are completely unrestricted,
and since the lexis of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF001} allows arbitrary strings
to be used as identifiers this is a feature not a bug, because, e.g., it allows the
HOL parser to interface with any other language embedded in HOL.
\item
Operations with a side effect have their arguments packaged as a single
tuple (i.e. they are not curried), so that there is less risk
of them being entered partially by the interactive user.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Information Stored}
The symbol table serves the lexical analyser,
parser, pretty printer and type inferrer
by supplying a mapping from identifiers onto information
which they may need.
Symbol table records are held for the following sorts of identifier:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
identifiers of type constructors
introduced with the interfaces defined in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD012};
\item
identifiers of constants
introduced with the interfaces defined in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD012};
\item
identifiers which have been declared as type abbreviations;
\item
identifiers which have been declared as aliases;
\item
identifiers which have been declared as binders, postfixes, infixes or prefixes;
\item
identifiers which have been declared as terminators.
\end{enumerate}

Also, to permit a descendant theory to override syntactic declarations in its
ancestors, records are held which serve to suppress the effect of
records of the last four sorts.


\section{PREAMBLE}
=DOC
signature ÛSymbolTableÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
This is the signature for the structure which contains the symbol
table and its access functions.
This structure contains private functions which are invoked as one
navigates around the theory database.
These private functions may give rise to error 20001 if the
theory database user data has been corrupted (e.g. by explicit and incorrect use
of the lower level interfaces).

Any of the functions in the structure which update the current theory may
give rise to error 20002

=FAILURE
20001	A symbol table entry in theory ?0 is corrupt (use restore_defaults to clear)
20002	The current theory, ?0, is not open for writing
20003	Internal error: ?0
=ENDDOC

\section{ACCESS FUNCTIONS}
\subsection{Terminators}
Errors in this subsection start with 201.

=DOC
	val Ûget_current_terminatorsÝ : unit -> string list list;
=DESCRIBE
$get\_current\_terminators()$ returns the list of identifiers which have been
declared as terminators in the current context using $new\_terminator$. The
names are returned in exploded form, i.e. as a list of strings each containing
one character.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
	val Ûdeclare_terminatorÝ : string -> unit
=DESCRIBE
$declare\_terminator\,s$ checks that $s$ is a valid terminator, and if so declares
that $s$ is to be used as a lexical terminator in the current context.
\ShowScripts
=FAILURE
20101	The string ?0 is not a valid terminator. Terminators must start
	with a symbolic character, must not contain spaces,
	and must not end with underscore, %up% or %down%
20102	The string ?0 is already declared as a terminator
=ENDDOC
=DOC
	val Ûundeclare_terminatorÝ : string -> unit
=DESCRIBE
$undeclare\_terminator\,s$ removes $s$
from the list of identifiers which act as terminators for parsing purposes
in the current context.
=FAILURE
20103	?0 is not in the list of terminators in the current context
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Fixity}
Errors in this subsection start with 202.

=DOC
	val Ûdeclare_binderÝ : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$declare\_binder\,s$ declares $s$ to have the syntactic status of a binder
in the current context.
$s$ must comply with the HOL lexical rules for an identifier and must not
be the string ``,''.
=SEEALSO
$undeclare\_fixity$
=FAILURE
20201	A fixity declaration is not allowed for ?0 (which is not an identifier)
20202	Cannot change the fixity of `,`
=ENDDOC

=DOC
	val Ûdeclare_left_infixÝ : (int * string)-> unit;
	val Ûdeclare_right_infixÝ : (int * string)-> unit;
	val Ûdeclare_infixÝ : (int * string)-> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$declare\_left\_infix\,(p, s)$ declares $s$ to have the syntactic status of an
left associative infix operator with precedence $p$
in the current context.
$s$ must comply with the HOL lexical rules for an identifier.

Similarly, $declare\_right\_infix$ is used to declare right associative operators.
$declare\_infix$ is provided for compatibility with earlier versions of the system and is the same as $declare\_right\_infix$.
=SEEALSO
$undeclare\_fixity$
=FAILURE
20201	A fixity declaration is not allowed for ?0 (which is not an identifier)
=ENDDOC

=DOC
	val Ûdeclare_prefixÝ : (int * string) -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$declare\_prefix\,(p, s)$ declares $s$ to have the syntactic status of a
prefix operator with precedence $p$ in the current context.
$s$ must comply with the HOL lexical rules for an identifier and must not
be the string ``,''.
=SEEALSO
$undeclare\_fixity$
=FAILURE
20201	A fixity declaration is not allowed for ?0 (which is not an identifier)
20202	Cannot change the fixity of `,`
=ENDDOC

=DOC
	val Ûdeclare_postfixÝ : (int * string) -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$declare\_postfix\,(p, s)$ declares $s$ to have the syntactic status of a
postfix operator with precedence $p$ in the current context.
$s$ must comply with the HOL lexical rules for an identifier and must not
be the string ``,''.
=SEEALSO
$undeclare\_fixity$
=FAILURE
20201	A fixity declaration is not allowed for ?0 (which is not an identifier)
20202	Cannot change the fixity of `,`
=ENDDOC

=DOC
	val Ûdeclare_nonfixÝ : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$declare\_nonfix\,s$ undoes the effect of a declaration of $s$ to
have special syntactic status (using $declare\_binder$, $declare\_infix$,
$declare\_prefix$ or $declare\_postfix$).

The effect of $declare\_nonfix\,s$ depends on the theory in which
the special status for $s$ was declared: if it was declared in the current
theory, then the declaration is just removed; if in an ancestor theory
then a declaration for $s$ as a nonfix is inserted in the current theory.
(Thus in the first case, the syntactic status for $s$ reverts to what
it was before the earlier declaration, whereas in the second case the syntactic
status will be suppressed.)

$s$ must not be the string ``,''.
=SEEALSO
$undeclare\_fixity$
=FAILURE
20201	A fixity declaration is not allowed for ?0 (which is not an identifier)
20202	Cannot change the fixity of `,`
20203	There is no fixity declaration for ?0 in the current context
=ENDDOC


=DOC
	val Ûget_fixityÝ : string -> Lex.FIXITY;
=DESCRIBE
$get\_fixity\,s$ returns the syntactic status of $s$ in the current context.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Constants and Aliases}
Errors in this subsection start with 203.

$get\_const\_info$ is the interface which the type inferrer will use to
give the type associated with a name in a parsed term. The type it should use
is the first element of the pair.

$get\_const\_info\,s$ is $Nil$ for an identifier, $s$ which is not the name of a constant
or an alias in the current context.
If s is a constant or an alias $get\_const\_info\,s$
has the form $Value(\tau, [(s_1, \tau_1), \ldots, (s_k, \tau_k)])$.
Each $s_i$ gives the
actual constant name to be associated with an occurrence of $s$
which has type an instance of $\tau_i$.
$\tau$ is the antiunifier of the $\tau_i$. For a constant which is not an
alias $k = 1$ and $\tau = \tau_1$.


Note that a name may be both an alias and an actual constant name.
For example, in the supplied system the conjunction
$get\_const\_info$``±'' will return something like:
=GFT Example
		Value(”BOOL­BOOL­BOOL®, [("±", ”BOOL­BOOL­BOOL®)])
=TEX
The user might wish to overload `±', e.g., by making it an alias of
the function `$fand$' defined by the following theorem:

=GFT Example
	ô µf g:'a->BOOL·fand f g x = f x ± g x
=TEX

The effect of the call
=GFT Example
	declare_alias("±", ¬fand:('a->BOOL)­('a->BOOL)­('a->BOOL)®);
=TEX
is to make the symbol table entry for  `±' something like:

=GFT Example
	Value(”'b­'b­'b®,
		[("fand", ”('a->BOOL)­('a->BOOL)­('a->BOOL)®),
					 ("±", ”BOOL­BOOL­BOOL®)])
=TEX


=DOC
	val Ûget_const_infoÝ : string -> (TYPE * ((string * TYPE)list)) OPT;
=DESCRIBE
$get\_const\_info\,a$ returns the information, $(\tau, cs)$, associated with
the name $a$ used as a constant name or an alias for a constant, if any.
$cs$ is the list of names and types of constants to which $a$ might refer
(as an alias or as the actual constant name).
$\tau$ is the type to use for this name during type inference, namely,
the antiunifier of the types in $cs$.
=ENDDOC


=DOC
	val Ûget_alias_infoÝ : string -> (string * TYPE)list OPT;
=DESCRIBE
$get\_alias\_info\,c$ returns the list of aliases for
the constant with name $c$, or $Nil$ if $c$ is not the name
of a constant. For each pair $(a, \tau)$ in the
result, $a$ is an alias for $c$ at instances of the type $\tau$.
=ENDDOC

=DOC
	val Ûdeclare_aliasÝ : (string * TERM) -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$declare\_alias\,(s, c)$ declares $s$ as an alias for the constant $c$.
$s$ must comply with the HOL lexical rules for an identifier.
=FAILURE
20301	The term ?0 is not a constant
20302	The string ?0 is already in use as an alias for ?1
20305	The constant ?0 is not in scope
20306	The string ?0 is not an identifier
=ENDDOC
=DOC
	val Ûundeclare_aliasÝ : (string * TERM) -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$undeclare\_alias\,(s, c)$ reverses the effect
of a declaration of $s$ as an alias for the constant $c$ in the current context.
This includes the possibility that $s$ is the name of $c$ itself.

The precise effect depends on the theory in which the alias
was declared: if it was declared in the current
theory, then the declaration is just removed
(so that if $s$ is declared as an alias for $c$ in an ancestor
theory, $s$ will still act as an alias for $c$ in the current theory);
if in an ancestor theory then arrangements are made in the
current theory to prevent $s$ acting as an alias for $c$.

If $s$ is the name of $c$ itself, the type inferrer will no longer
recognise $s$ as a reference to $c$. In this case,
$c$ may be accessed either via an alias or via an ML quotation.
This gives a work-around for the potential problem when a theory
contains a constant whose name is needed as a variable name in
some application using the theory.


=FAILURE
20301	The term ?0 is not a constant
20303	The identifier ?0 is not declared as an alias for ?1
=ENDDOC

=DOC
	val Ûresolve_aliasÝ : (string * TYPE) -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
$resolve\_alias(s, \tau)$ returns a term of the form $mk\_const(c, \tau)$ where
$c$ is the ``best' resolution for the identifier $s$. This best resolution
will be $s$ if $s$ has been introduced as a constant of type $\tau'$
where $\tau'$ is an instance of $\tau$.
If $s$ is an alias then $c$ is taken from the alias declaration for $s$
in which the aliased constant has a type $\tau'$ which can be instantiated
to $\tau$. If more than one such declaration is applicable the most recent
one is used.
=FAILURE
20304	The identifier ?0 is not a valid constant name (or alias) at this type
=ENDDOC


=DOC
	val Ûget_aliasÝ : (string * TYPE) -> string;
=DESCRIBE
$get\_alias(c, \tau)$ returns the most appropriate alias for the constant
with name $c$ at the type $\tau$.
If no aliases for the name $c$ have been declared then $c$ is returned
otherwise the most recent alias $s$ associated with a type $\tau'$ which
can be instantiated to $\tau$ is returned.
=ENDDOC

\subsection{Types and Type Abbreviations}
Errors in this subsection start with 204.


=DOC
	val Ûget_type_infoÝ : string -> (int * (string list * TYPE) OPT) OPT;
=DESCRIBE
$get\_type\_info\,s$ returns information about the identifier $s$ when
it appears as a type constructor or type abbreviation.
$get\_type\_info\,s$ is $Nil$ for an identifier
which is not a type constructor or a type
abbreviation in the current context.
Otherwise $get\_type\_info\,s$
gives the arity of the constructor or abbreviation and
a field which is $Nil$ for a constructor and which otherwise
gives the type for which $s$ is an abbreviation
together with the names of its formal parameters.
=ENDDOC

Unlike the other declaration interfaces, $declare\_type\_abbrev$ gives
a warning message if the new type abbreviation would clash with an existing
type abbreviation or type constructor. This is mainly for the case of
a clash with a type constructor, where the constructor will become
inaccessible via the parser if the new type abbreviation is introduced.
=DOC
	val Ûdeclare_type_abbrevÝ : (string * string list * TYPE) -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$declare\_type\_abbrev\,(s, [\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_k], \tau)$
declares $(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_k)s$
as a type abbreviation for the type $\tau$.
The identifier $s$ may not already have been declared as
a type abbreviation or be the name of a type constructor defined in
the present context, in which cases a warning message is issued.
$s$ must comply with the HOL lexical rules for an identifier.
=FAILURE
20401	The identifier ?0 is already declared as a type abbreviation
20402	The identifier ?0 is already declared as a type constructor
20407	The formal parameter list ?0 contains duplicate type variable names
20408	The string ?0 is not an identifier
=ENDDOC
It is intended that the type inferrer, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD016},
will expand type abbreviations
in a depth-first fashion (using $get\_type\_abbrev$) and will not
recursively expand type abbreviations in the result.
Therefore it is permitted, but not very useful, for the type $\tau$ above to
contain compound types with type constructors which are not defined
as such, or which are even equal to $s$, the type abbreviation being defined,
since this cannot result in an infinite recursion. The type will normally
be entered by the user
via the usual quotation mechanism, in which case these anomalous
situations will not arise.

=DOC
	val Ûundeclare_type_abbrevÝ : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$undeclare\_type\_abbrev\,(s, [\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_k], \tau)$
reverses the effect of a declaration of $s$ as a type abbreviation.

The precise effect depends on the theory in which the type abbreviation
was declared: if it was declared in the current
theory, then the declaration is just removed
(so that if $s$ is declared as a type abbreviation in an ancestor
theory, $s$ will revert to whatever that declaration said);
if in an ancestor theory then arrangements are made in the
current theory to prevent $s$ being treated as a type abbreviation.

=FAILURE
20403	The identifier ?0 is not declared as a type abbreviation
=ENDDOC

=DOC
	val Ûis_type_abbrevÝ : string -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
$is\_type\_abbrev\,s$ returns $true$ iff. $s$ is declared as a type abbreviation
=ENDDOC

=DOC
	val Ûget_type_abbrevÝ : TYPE -> (string * TYPE list) OPT;
=DESCRIBE
$get\_type\_abbrev\,ty$ returns a type abbreviation and arguments that expand
to $ty$ is any suitable type abbreviation exists.
The type abbreviation returned is the most recent which has $ty$ as an instance.
$Nil$ is returned if the $ty$ has no suitable abbreviation.
=FAILURE
20404	The identifier ?0 is not declared as a type abbreviation
=ENDDOC
=DOC
	val Ûexpand_type_abbrevÝ : (string * TYPE list) -> TYPE;
=DESCRIBE
$expand\_type\_abbrev\,s,[\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_k]$ is the
expansion of the type abbreviation $s$ with respect to the arguments
$[\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_k]$.
=FAILURE
20404	The identifier ?0 is not declared as a type abbreviation
20405	The type abbreviation ?0 should have ?1 argument not ?2
20406	The type abbreviation ?0 should have ?1 arguments not ?2
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Languages}
Errors in this subsection start with 205.

The symbol table stores a language indicator in each theory.
This determines the language in the symbol table records for the names
in that theory. The language indicator for a new theory is initially taken
from its (first) parent. The language indicator for the initial theory
$MIN$ is set to ``$HOL$''.
=DOC
	val Ûset_current_languageÝ : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$set\_current\_language\,s$ sets the language indicator associated with
the current theory to $s$.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
	val Ûget_current_languageÝ : unit -> string;
=DESCRIBE
$get\_current\_language\,()$ returns the language indicator associated with
the current theory.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
	val Ûget_const_languageÝ : string -> string list;
=DESCRIBE
$get\_const\_language\,s$ returns the language indicators associated with
the name $s$ when used as a constant
in the current context. If there is no constant
called $s$, then $get\_const\_language\,s$ returns the language indicator associated
with the current theory. The language indicator is
``$HOL$'' for all identifiers supplied as part of the ICL HOL system.
The head element of the list returned is the language indicator associated
with the constant's declaring theory.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
	val Ûdeclare_const_languageÝ : string * string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$declare\_const\_language\,(s, l)$ adds the language indicator~$l$ to
those associated with the name~$s$ when used as a constant in the current context.

20501	There is no constant called ?0 in the current context
=ENDDOC

\subsection{Theory Access Functions}
Errors in this subsection start with 206.

a given theory. The main client for these facilities is the theory

useful.

is a list of pairs. Each pair contains the name of the corresponding type
abbreviation together with its formal arguments and the type for which
it is an abbreviation.
The list is in the order of declaration (oldest first).

$get\_undeclared\_type\_abbrevs\,thy$ returns the list of identifiers which have
have had their status as type abbreviations suppressed in the theory $thy$.
The list is in the order of declaration (oldest first).

	val Ûget_aliasesÝ : string -> (string * TERM) list;
=DESCRIBE
$get\_aliases\,thy$ returns information about identifiers which have
have been declared as aliases in the theory $thy$.
The return value is a list of pairs. Each pair contains a name and a
constant for which that name is an alias. The same name may be used as an alias
for several different constants, and if this happens there will be multiple
entries for that alias in the list.
The list is in the order of declaration (oldest first).

	val Ûget_undeclared_aliasesÝ : string -> (string * TERM) list;
=DESCRIBE
$get\_undeclared\_aliases\,thy$ returns information about aliases which
have been suppressed (with $undeclare\_alias$) in the theory $thy$.
The return value is a list of pairs. Each pair contains a name and a
constant for which that name is no longer to be used as an alias.
There may be more than one entry for a given name in the list (since several
$undeclare\_alias$ commands may apply to one name).
The list is in the order of undeclaration (oldest first).

	val Ûrestore_defaultsÝ : unit -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$restore\_defaults()$ may be used to clear corrupted symbol
table information in the current theory. It does this by restoring the theory
to the state it would have if no terminator, fixity, alias, type abbreviations
or language declarations had been performed. A warning message is issued
(and the interactive user is prompted as to whether to continue) before the
operation is performed.
