\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for the first group of tactics
and tacticals.
This is called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD009}.
The design is implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP009}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the
first group of tactics and tacticals for ICL HOL.
This first group is mainly concerned with supplying facilities
for constructing the tactics which the interactive user uses.

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This document depends on the type definitions in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD006}.
The implementation is dependent on the derived rules of
inference in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP007}.

\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.

\subsubsection{Terminology}
A {\em tactic} is a function which attempts to prove a goal. Here a {\em goal} is
just a sequent. Given a goal of a form which it finds acceptable, a tactic
returns a list of new goals (often referred to as
the {\em subgoals}), together with a {\em proof}, i.e. a function
value which given theorems achieving the subgoals can compute a theorem
matching the original goal. Here, roughly speaking,
a theorem, $\Gammaôt$, {\em achieves} a goal, $gl$,
iff. $gl = (\Gamma, t)$ (see section \ref{OnUsingTactics} below for
more information).

A {\em tactical} is a function which composes one or more tactics and perhaps
parameters of other types in
some way (e.g. by repetition until failure) to produce a new tactic.
A {\em tactic generating function} is used for any function which computes
a tactic.

By a minor abuse of terminology the term tactic is frequently used to
describe a function which takes one or more arguments which are not tactics
and computes a tactic.
A very common form of tactic in this broader sense is a
{\em theorem tactic}, i.e., a function which takes a theorem and returns
a tactic.
{\em Theorem tacticals} are functions which compose one or more
theorem tactics in some way to produce a new theorem tactic.
{\em Theorem tactical combinators} are functions which produce
new theorem tacticals from old.

\section{GENERAL REMARKS}

\subsection{Naming and Type Conventions}

We adopt the following clarifications/extensions of
the naming conventions given in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF003}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\hline
Object & Suffix & Type\\\hline
tactic & $\_tac$ &
$[ty ­]TACTIC$
\\\hline
theorem tactic & $\_tac$ &
$[ty ­]THM ­ TACTIC$
\\\hline
tactical & $\_T$ &
$ty(TACTIC) ­ TACTIC$
\\\hline
theorem tactical & $\_THEN$ &
$ty(THM ­ TACTIC) ­ THM ­ TACTIC$
\\\hline
theorem tactical combinator & $\_TTCL$ &
$ty((THM ­ TACTIC) ­ (THM ­ TACTIC)) ­$ \\
& & $\ \ \ \ \ \ (THM ­ TACTIC) ­ (THM ­ TACTIC)$
\\\hline
\end{tabular}

where $ty$ denotes a Standard ML type expression, where $[ ...]$ indicates
a part of the type which may be omitted, and where we assume that
the type abbreviations $THM\_TACTIC$ and $THM\_TACTICAL$ defined in
section \ref{TYPEABBREVIATIONS} below have been expanded.
Note that an object of type $\scriptscriptstyle ty(TACTIC) ­ THM ­ TACTIC$ is to be named
as a tactical (rather than a theorem tactic)
if it is not a theorem tactical.

It should be noted that the type
abbreviations $THM\_TACTIC$ and $THM\_TACTICAL$ are not
generally used in the type constraints for particular theorem tactics
or theorem tactical combinators. This is because it is felt more helpful
to the less experienced user to be told, for example, that $asm\_tac$
has type $THM ­ TACTIC$, rather than having to learn that there is
a type abbreviation $THM\_TACTIC$ for this type.
On the other hand, to make the types more memorable for the experienced
user, the type abbreviations are used to constrain the types of such
things as theorem tactical combinators (such as $THEN\_TTCL$).
The decision whether to use the type abbreviations or not is largely
a matter of taste.

\subsection{On Using Tactics}\label{OnUsingTactics}
In the previous section we said that a theorem $\Gammaôt$,
achieves a goal, $gl$, iff. $gl = (\Gamma, t)$. In fact, there would be
a significant performance cost if tactics were required to achieve goals
in this strict sense. Instead, the theorem, $\Gammaôt$, is actually taken to
achieve a goal, $(asms, conc)$, if $\Gamma\subseteq asms$ and $t = conc$
modulo $\alpha$-conversion. Thus, the theorem proved by a tactic
applied to a given goal may require a certain amount of additional inferences
($\alpha$-conversions and addition of assumptions) to give a theorem which
achieves the goal in the strict sense.

Both the subgoal package and
the utility $tac\_proof$ (which is used to do non-interactive proofs with tactics) take
the necessary measures to give the user the theorem he asked for.

\subsection{Treatment of Assumptions}\label{TreatmentofAssumptions}

The general policy to be adopted in tactics which add new assumptions is
that the new assumptions are always to be added at the head of the list
even if this gives rise to duplicated assumptions (modulo $\alpha$-convertibility).
This helps the interactive user manage the assumption list as a stack or an array
without having to predict the effect of a given tactic.
Tactics should not assume
that the assumptions in a goal are all distinct,
e.g. tactics which remove assumptions
should remove all instances of the assumptions to be removed.

Some tacticals must assume that their tactic arguments generate proofs which
are not sensitive to the presence of additional assumptions in the theorems
presented to them as arguments. All proofs generated by ICL-supplied tactics
will have this property (which is easily effected by avoiding use of rules
which do global operations on the assumption lists).

\subsection{Use of Theorems by Tactics}
Many tactics use theorems (supplied as, or computed by, their arguments).
There is an issue as to what one should do with the assumptions of such
theorems.

At first glance, one would imagine that any assumptions in the theorem
which are not also in the goal should be set as additional subgoals.
This convention would work nicely in circumstances where the theorem had
been proved indepently of the goal in question.

However, what frequently happens, e.g. with $POP\_ASM\_T$, is that a theorem, say $thm$,
is made by applying $asm\_rule$ to an assumption, $asm$ say. The assumption is then
removed from the goal, and the resulting goal is attacked with $ttac\,thm$ where
$ttac$ is some theorem tactic. In such usage, what is being assumed is that
$ttac$ will produce a `proof' of the intermediate goal which may actually
introduce $asm$ as an additional assumption, but that this will not matter
since the original goal did indeed have such an assumption.
This approach is not compatible with the convention mentioned in the
previous paragraph.

The tactics and tacticals supplied are therefore designed on the assumption
that there calling environment will make any necessary checks on the applicability
of theorems supplied by the user. $tac\_proof$ is a very simple example
of such an environment, which will simply fail if essential use is made of
a theorem with an unwarranted assumption.
The subgoal package (see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD030}), which
gives an interactive environment for developing proofs using tactics,
causes any extra assumptions to be set as additional subgoals.

\section{INFIX DIRECTIVES}
A Standard ML $infix$ directive must be given at the ``top level''.
Thus we give the directives here for those functions declared in the following signatures.

\section{UTILITIES}
This document exports several utilities which are of use in constructing other
tactics:
=DOC
val Ûmap_shapeÝ : (('a list -> 'b) * int) list -> 'a list -> 'b list
=DESCRIBE
$map\-\_shape$ is a means of composing functions on lists.
It is intended for composing the proofs produced by tactics
in tacticals such as $THEN$.
Its effect is as follows:
=GFT
		map_shape [(f1, n1), (f2, n2)... ] [a1, a2, ...]
	=	[f1[a1, ..., a(n1)], f2[a(n1+1), ..., a(n1+n2)], ...]
=TEX
where, if there are not enough $a_i$, then unused $f_j$ are ignored and the
last $f_j$ to be used may receive less than $n_j$ elements in its argument.
(This case is not expected to occur in the application of $map\_shape$
in tactic programming.)
=USES
Specialised low-level tactic programming.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûbad_proofÝ : string -> 'a
=DESCRIBE
$bad\_proof\,name$ is equivalent to $error\,name\,9001\,[]$.
$bad\_proof$ is for use in low level tactical programming to report
the error situation when the proof generated by a tactic is supplied with
the wrong number of arguments.
(This will not happen for the usual use of tactics with $tac\_proof$ or
within the subgoal package):

$rename\_tac$ renames variables (bound or free) in a goal.
It is typically used when a goal contains several variables with
the same name or to introduce names which are better mnemonics.
For the latter purpose,
the argument controls the algorithm used to
make variants of the names.

The renaming affects both the conclusions and the assumptions of the goal.
Variables are renamed to ensure that the new goal
satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item
No two free variables with different types have the same name.
\item
No bound variable has the same name as a free variable or a variable
which is bound in an outer scope.
\item
No variable shall have the same name as any constant in scope.
\end{itemize}


Before a variable is checked,
it is looked up in the $renaming$ association list,
and if present it is treated as if
the name were the corresponding string.
The function $variant$, q.v., is used to rename variables.


The function may be partially evaluated with only the renamings argument.

Note that applying the tactic in the subgoal package will give rise to the message
``The subgoal $<$label$>$ is $Á$-convertible to its goal''.

\section{BASIC TACTICALS}

\subsection{Using Assumptions}
(Errors in this section begin with 93.)

We supply tacticals which give the user several ways of
using assumptions as arguments to tactic generating functions.
The options are which assumptions to select and whether or not
the assumptions are to be removed from or left in the assumption list.
The combinations are then as shown in the following table:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\hline
			& Remove Asms			& Leave Asms.
\\\hline
Select Given Asm.	& $DROP\_ASM\_T$		& $GET\_ASM\_T$
\\\hline
Select List of Given Asm.	& $LIST\_DROP\_ASM\_T$		& $LIST\_GET\_ASM\_T$
\\\hline
Select Top Asm.		& $POP\_ASM\_T$			& $TOP\_ASM\_T$
\\\hline
Select All Asms.	& $DROP\_ASMS\_T$			& $GET\_ASMS\_T$
\\\hline
Select $n-th$ Asm.	& $DROP\_NTH\_ASM\_T$		& $GET\_NTH\_ASM\_T$
\\\hline
Select $m,n,p,...$ Asm.	& $LIST\_DROP\_NTH\_ASM\_T$		& $LIST\_GET\_NTH\_ASM\_T$\\\hline
\end{tabular}

Note the following:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
The tactic generating function
supplied as an argument to the tactical may
elect to remove assumptions of its own accord --- the above table refers
to the assumptions passed to the tactic generating function.

\item
In accordance with section \ref{TreatmentofAssumptions}
above, the functions which remove assumptions work modulo $\alpha$convertibility.

\item
The functions which work with indexed assumptions are to number the assumptions
$1, 2, \ldots$. Thus, for example, $POP\_ASM\_T$ is the same
as $DROP\_NTH\_ASM\_T\,1$.
\item
Other options, e.g., selection of a subset of the assumptions satisfying
a given condition, may be coded in terms of $GET\_ASMS\_T$
or $DROP\_ASMS\_T$ by applying a tactic
generating function with an appropriate filtering action.
\item
The assumption or assumptions selected by these functions are passed to the
tactic generating functions as theorems (which is what is required in the
most common modes of use). $dest\_thm$ may be used if the
tactic generating function works with terms.
