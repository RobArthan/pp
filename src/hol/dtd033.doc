\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains the detailed design for the theory lister module for ICL HOL.
The high level design for this material is given in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD008}.

\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
As identified in the high-level design document,
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD008}, the user of the HOL system needs a means of listing out in a
readable format the contents of a theory and also means for cross
referencing definitions of objects against there uses in one or more
theories. It is the purpose of this document to meet these requirements.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This document is dependent on the pretty printer functions for HOL
defined in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD025}.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
The theory lister is currently defined not to list out theory status, or anything
to do with theorem level numbers --- since the functional
interfaces of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD012} allow this information to be
extracted when necessary and most users will not wish to see it as a matter
of course. This information could be optionally included under the control
of a system flag.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
Interfaces should be supplied allowing the width of screen and \TeX\ fonts
to be declared and the lister should format its listings on the basis
of these widths. As things stand it must use an average figure for the widths.
It may be desirable for user to control the width of the \TeX\ listing.

The cross-referencer is TBA.

\section{DISCUSSION}
\subsection{Theory Lister}
\subsubsection{Information to be Listed}
As described in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD006} and \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD012},
an ICL HOL theory acts as a container for information of two sorts:
protected logical information and user-defined data. Within
the ICL HOL system itself, the principal use of the user-defined
data is by the symbol table module, see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD020},
which uses it to implement the various syntactic devices supported
by the ICL HOL concrete syntax. It is the purpose of the theory
lister to enable the user to see a readable representation of
the logical information and of the information managed by
the symbol table module.

It may be seen from \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD006} that the logical information
may be collected together under the various sorts of object which
are stored as follows:

{\center
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{4in}|}\hline
Object & Information to be listed \\ \hline\hline

Parent & the name \\\hline
Child & the name \\\hline
Type Constructor & arity of the constructor\\\hline
Constant & type of the constant \\\hline
Definition & the defining theorem (as a sequent) \\\hline
Axiom & the axiom (as a sequent)\\\hline
Theorem & the theorem as a sequent \\\hline
\end{tabular}}

From \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD020}, one sees that the symbol table information
is to cover the following the sorts of object listed in the following
table:

{\center
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{4in}|}\hline
Object & Information to be listed \\\hline\hline
\begin{tabular}{c}
Binder \\
Nonfix \\
\end{tabular}
	& the fact that the name is declared as such \\\hline
\begin{tabular}{c}
Infix \\
Postfix \\
Prefix \\
\end{tabular}
	& the fact that the name is declared as such and the numeric precedence \\\hline
Terminator & the fact that the name is declared as such \\\hline
Undeclared Terminator & the fact that the terminator has been undeclared \\\hline
Type Abbreviation & the formal parameters and the type abbreviated \\\hline
Undeclared Type Abbreviation & the fact that the type abbreviation has been undeclared  \\\hline
Alias & the string-type pairs corresponding to the constants for which
the name is an alias \\\hline
Undeclared Alias & the string-type pairs corresponding to the constants for which
this name has had its alias status undeclared \\\hline
\end{tabular}}


In addition, we should list the language of the theory (at least if it is
not HOL).
\subsection{Listing Format}
Experience with earlier HOL systems suggests that use of a tabular layout
for things such as the listing of constants and their types would ease
readability.

A decision to be made with regard to the listing format is whether to list syntactic
status separately or to attempt to include it elsewhere. For example, we might
decorate a constant name in the list of constants and their types with 
underscores (and, for binders a `∑') indicating where the operands of the
constant go (after the style of Z). Unfortunately we would still need a separate
listing for the names with special status which are not defined as types,
constants etc. Given this consideration, a separate listing of the names
with special status would seem appropriate.

From the previous section, we arrive at a format for
the listing containing the following 14 sections of information about a theory:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
Section & Contents \\\hline
$parents$ & the parents of the theory \\\hline
$children$ & the children of the theory \\\hline
$constants$ & the names and types of the constants \\\hline
$aliases$ & a list of alias names and the corresponding constants \\\hline
$undeclared$ $alias$ & a list of the aliases which have been undeclared \\\hline
$types$ & the names and arities of the types \\\hline
$type$ $abbreviations$ & a list of the type abbreviations and their expansions \\\hline
$undeclared$ $type$ $abbreviations$ & a list of the undeclared type abbreviations \\\hline
$fixity$ & information about fixity declarations \\\hline
$terminators$ & information about terminator declarations \\\hline
$undeclared$ $terminators$ & information about terminator undeclarations \\\hline
$axioms$ & the axioms \\\hline
$definitions$ & the definitions \\\hline
$theorems$ & the theorems \\\hline
\end{tabular}

A rather untypical example exhibiting all 14 sections is given in
section \ref{ExampleListing} below and the reader is invited
to look at it before reading the rest of this section.

A banner line containing the theory
name appears at the beginning of the listing. 
Each section is preceded by a header indicating what is to follow.
Sections in which there is nothing to be listed will be omitted.
The end of the listing is marked by a trailer line (which like the banner
contains the theory name).

The fixity section is organised into subsections according to fixity
and precedence (see the example in section \ref{ExampleListing} below).

Every section of the table is laid out in two horizontal
fields: a fairly narrow left-hand
{\em label}
field typically containing some form of label and a right-hand 
{\em value} field
filling the rest of the width containing a table or a value like a theorem.

The label
field (two tab stops wide in the example) is empty in sections, such
as $parents$ which just contain lists of names. In the fixity section,
which essentially contains lists of names labelled by fixity information,
the left-hand field contains the fixity information. In other sections
the left-hand field is used for the name or names of the object of
interest (e.g. the name of a constant or the names of a definition).

The value field either contains a single value such as a type or a theorem,
or, in the case of
$parents$, $children$, $fixity$, $terminators$, and $undeclared$ $terminator$
contains a multicolumn table.
Each such table is given column widths sufficiently
wide to accommodate the widest name in the table.
The value field is empty in the case of the $types$ section, since all the
relevant information there is contained in the displayed instance of the
type (which is put in the label field rather than the value field for
uniformity with the $constants$ section).

The width of the left-hand field is under user control via
a system control variable, $listing\_indent$. The overall width of the listing
as displayed on the screen is
governed by the $line\_length$ control variable described in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD001}. 

The user may ask for lists of items to be sorted alphabetically
using a system control flag. The lists in the fixity
section are always sorted, since the organisation by precedence value
means that no other order is useful (and in any case the order of the fixity
declarations has no impact, unlike, say, constant definitions).

\subsection{Message Definitions}

The following message definitions are used to achieve the above format:

=FAILURE
33001	The theory ?0
33002	Parents
33003	Children
33004	Constants
33005	Aliases
33006	Types
33007	Type Abbreviations
33008	Fixity
33009	Terminators
33010	Axioms
33011	Definitions
33012	Theorems
33013	Undeclared Aliases
33014	Undeclared Type Abbreviations
33015	Undeclared Terminators
33020	Binder:
33021	Infix ?0:
33022	Nonfix:
33023	Postfix ?0:
33024	Prefix ?0:
33030	End of listing of theory ?0
33031	THE THEORY ?0
=TEX


\subsubsection{Interface with \TeX}
To interface the lister with \TeX, the lister produces a file containing
the theory listing interleaved with {\tt screen} (see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR001})
directive lines to distinguish the various parts of the listing.
The directives used are shown in the following table:

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{3in}|}\hline
Directive & Purpose \\\hline
{\tt =THEORYLISTINGBANNER} & The header at the beginning of the listing\\\hline
{\tt =THEORYLISTINGSECTION} & A section header\\\hline
{\tt =THEORYLISTINGTABLE} & A section in which the value column contains
a multicolumn table\\\hline
{\tt =THEORYLISTINGOTHER} & A section in which the right-hand column contains
individual values like theorems\\\hline
{\tt =THEORYLISTINGTRAILER} & The trailer line at the end of the listing\\\hline
{\tt =TEX} & This directive marks the end of a piece of text introduced
by one of the other directives\\\hline
\end{tabular}

A tab character is used to separate the label and value fields and to
separate the columns of a multicolumn table.

\section{TEST POLICY}
The symbol table functions are to be tested according to the
general criteria laid down in the quality plan, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008}.
The automated module tests will only be able to test a limited amount
of the functionality. The important matter of checking the displayed and
printed format of the listings must be done by human
inspection in the integration testing.
