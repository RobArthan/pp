\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for the
rewriting rules, conversions and tactics, and some auxiliary material.
This is called for in section \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD009}.
The design is implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP026}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the rewriting
derived rules, conversions and tactics for ICL HOL.

``Rewriting'' is a process of traversing a goal, theorem or term instantiating members of a set of equational theorems to match sub-terms encountered, and using the instantiations to infer a new goal, theorem, or an equational theorem.
We have enhanced the rewriting facilities in ICL HOL to apply
conversions.
In this context a conversion is viewed as a function capable of deriving an equational theorem, which is given
as an argument the LHS that the resulting equation must have.

An auxiliary topic needs covering to describe
rewriting.
It is canonicalisation, which is basically
the process of taking a theorem and producing equational theorems from it.
The process is configurable.

All functions require all their arguments to begin evaluation,
unless otherwise noted.

Note also that the order of declaration given in this document will
not necessarily reflect the order of implementation in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP026}.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Though this document depends upon \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP028}.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
None known.
\subsubsection{Terminology}
A {\em conversion net} is more properly called a conversion discrimination net: discrimination nets are described in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD008}.
\section{INFIX DIRECTIVES}

infix notation:

\section{CANONICALISATION}
\subsection{Discussion}\label{CANONICALISATIONDiscussion}
We will use the term
{\em canonicalisation} for an operation which transforms a theorem (or list
of theorems) into a list of theorems all of which share some property.
An example of a canonicalisation is the parameter to
the primitive rewrite conversion which transforms
lists of theorems into lists of equational theorems.
Another example might be reduction to clausal form.

For the present example,
the rewriting canonicalisation might be something like the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
stripping universal quantifiers;
\item
dividing conjunctive theorems into their conjuncts (and then recursively
transforming these);
\item
changing $Ù≥t$ to $t § F$;
\item
if none of the above apply, changing $Ùt$ to $Ùt § T$.
\end{enumerate}

however, application-specific transformations might apply, e.g. removing
universal quantifiers in languages other than HOL. In fact the above is
a simplification of what we actually propose
(in section \ref{CanonicalisationForRewriting} below)
for the rewriting canonicalisation.

To give a simple but general framework for handling canonicalisation, we
introduce a family of combinators for functions of type
$THM->THM\,list$. These allow a recursive process like the above-mentioned
rewriting canonicalisation to be extended piecemeal:
for instance the code
for the standard rewriting canonicalisation contains the fragment:
=GFT
REPEAT_CAN (FIRST_CAN <list of canonicalisations>)
=TEX

The canonicalisation combinators are very straightforward to implement; indeed,
they are even simpler than the combinators for tactics and conversions.
They may also prove useful in other contexts.

\subsection{The Canonicalisation Combinators}

=DOC
type €CANON› 		(* 	= THM -> (THM list)	*);
=DESCRIBE
This is the type abbreviation for a canonicalisation function; such functions
are typically used to derive consequences of a theorem meeting some desired
criteria. An example is the rewriting canonicalisations which are used to transform theorems
into lists of equational theorems for use in the rewriting conversions, rules
and tactics.

Combinators are available to assist in the construction of new
canonicalisation functions from old.

\subsection{Canonicalisation For Rewriting}\label{CanonicalisationForRewriting}
The discussion in section \ref{CANONICALISATIONDiscussion}
of canonicalisation for rewriting actually
described a simpler process than the one which we adopt for standard use
(i.e. place $set\_rw\_canon$ in the initial rewriting canonicalisation proof context).

We adopt the following criteria for the rewriting canonicalisations that ICL will supply:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
given $Ùa$, they should guarantee that $rewrite\_tac$ will prove a goal
with conclusion $a$ providing it terminates;
\item
they should be relatively efficient (say, linear in the number of connectives
in the theorem being rewritten);
\item
they should generate as many useful equations as can conveniently be done
within the above constraints.
\end{enumerate}

Given the basic rewrites discussed in section \ref{BASICREWRITES}
below, the criteria are met by repeated application of the first applicable
operation in the following list:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
stripping universal quantifiers;
\item
dividing conjunctive theorems into their conjuncts;
\item
changing $Ù≥(t1 ≤ t2)$ to $≥t1 ± ≥t2$;
\item
changing $Ù≥∂x∑t$ to $µx∑≥t$;
\item
changing $Ù≥≥t$ to $t$;
\item
changing $Ù≥t$ to $t § F$;
\item
if none of the above apply, changing $Ùt$ to $Ùt § T$.
\end{enumerate}

The point here is that we move negations through disjunctions and existential
quantifiers because that can increase the number of useful equations we get
without prejudicing criterion 1 (by dint of the basic rewrites which
can evaluate disjunctions and existential terms in which the operands or body
is $T$).

After all this canonicalisation we then universally quantify
the resulting theorems in all free variables only in the conclusions, other than those
that were free in the original.

A variant canonicalisation would strip implications
into the assumption list, as well as adding the unstripped form.
The effects caused by this could be unfortunate if unconstrained,
and so it is not adopted as the default action.

=DOC
val €±_rewrite_canon› : THM -> THM list
val €simple_≥_rewrite_canon› : THM -> THM list
val €§_t_rewrite_canon› : THM -> THM list
val €f_rewrite_canon› : THM -> THM list
val €simple_µ_rewrite_canon› : THM -> THM list
=DESCRIBE
These are some of the standard canonicalisation functions used for breaking theorems up into
lists of equations for use in rewriting. They perform the following
transformations:
=GFT
±_rewrite_canon			(á Ù t1 ± t2)		= á Ù t1 ; á Ù t2
simple_≥_rewrite_canon		(á Ù ≥(t1 ≤ t2))	= (á Ù ≥t1 ± ≥t2)	
simple_≥_rewrite_canon		(á Ù ≥∂x∑t)		= (á Ù µx∑≥t)	
simple_≥_rewrite_canon		(á Ù ≥ ≥t)		= (á Ù t)	
simple_≥_rewrite_canon		(á Ù ≥t)		= (á Ù t § F)	
§_t_rewrite_canon		(á Ù t1 = t2)		= < failure >
§_t_rewrite_canon		(á Ù t)			= (á Ù t § T)
f_rewrite_canon			(á Ù F)			= (á Ù µ x ∑ x)
simple_µ_rewrite_canon		(á Ù µx∑t)		= á Ù t
=TEX


Note that the functions whose names begin with $simple$  do not handle paired quantifiers.
Versions which do handle these quantifiers are also available.

=FAILURE
26203	the conclusion of the theorem is already an equation
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val €REWRITE_CAN› : CANON -> CANON;
=DESCRIBE
For rewriting, after all other canonicalisation we will usually
wish to then universally quantify
the resulting theorems in all free variables that are only in the conclusion, other than those
that were free anywhere in the original theorem, before
any canonicalisation.
A canonicalisation is transformed to work this way by $REWRITE\_CAN$.

When evaluating proof contexts (see, e.g., $commit\_pc$) the list of rewrite canonicalisations
in the argument (see $get\_rw\_canons$), $arg$, will be converted to a single canonicalisation
in the result by:
=GFT
REWRITE_CAN
	(REPEAT_CAN(FIRST_CAN (arg @
		[§_t_rewrite_canon])));
=TEX

=ENDDOC
=DOC
val €initial_rw_canon› : CANON;
=DESCRIBE
This is the initial rewrite canonicalisation function,
defined as
=GFT
val initial_rw_canon =
	REWRITE_CAN
	(REPEAT_CAN(FIRST_CAN [
	simple_µ_rewrite_canon,
	±_rewrite_canon,
	simple_≥_rewrite_canon,
	f_rewrite_canon,
	§_t_rewrite_canon]));
=TEX
This is the repeated application of the first applicable
operation in the following list:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
stripping universal quantifiers;
\item
dividing conjunctive theorems into their conjuncts;
\item
changing $Ù≥(t1 ≤ t2)$ to $≥t1 ± ≥t2$;
\item
changing $Ù≥∂x∑t$ to $µx∑≥t$;
\item
changing $Ù≥≥t$ to $t$;
\item
changing $Ù≥t$ to $t § F$;
\item
changing $Ù\ F$ to $Ù\ µ\ x\ ∑\ x$;
\item
if none of the above apply, changing $Ùt$ to $Ùt = T$.

Finally, after all this canonicalisation we then universally quantify
the resulting theorems in all free variables other than those
that were free in the original.

\end{enumerate}

=ENDDOC
\subsection{Canonicalisation and Equational Contexts}
We can now express the function that creates an equational context of a theorem canonicalised by the
other parameter:
=DOC
val €cthm_eqn_cxt› : CANON -> THM -> EQN_CXT;
=DESCRIBE
This function applies a canonicalisation (see $CANON$) to
a theorem, and then attempts to convert each of the
list of resulting theorems into an equational
context entry using $thm\_eqn\_cxt$ (q.v.).
The results are composed into an equational context
(which is only a Standard ML list of equational context entries).
Canoncalised theorems that cannot be converted by $thm\_eqn\_cxt$ will be discarded.
=ENDDOC
\section{THE REWRITING FUNCTIONS}
\subsection{The Underlying Conversion}
The following general and powerful conversion is at the heart of all the other
rewriting functions.
=DOC
val €prim_rewrite_conv› : CONV NET -> CANON -> (THM -> TERM * CONV) OPT ->
	(CONV -> CONV) -> EQN_CXT -> THM list -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
The primitive rewrite conversion.
=FRULE 1 Conversion
prim_rewrite_conv
(initial_net: CONV NET)
(canon : CANON)
(eqm_rule : (THM -> TERM * CONV) OPT)
(traverse : CONV -> CONV)
(with_eqn_cxt : EQN_CXT)
(with_thms : THM list) ¨tÆ
˜
˜
á Ù t = t'
=TEX
where ¨t'Æ is ¨tÆ, rewritten according to the parameters of the
conversion, and $á$ are the assumptions required to allow the
rewriting. The failure of the conversion constructed by $prim\_rewrite\_conv$ will not be caught by $prim\_rewrite\_conv$.

The arguments have the following effects:
\begin{description}
\item[initial\_net]
This is a pre-calculated conversion net, that will serve
as the initial rewriting that may be done.
\item[canon]
This canonicalisation function
will be applied to all of the $with\_thms$ theorems, to produce a list of theorems to be rewritten with from these inputs.
This will generally involve producing canonical or simplified
forms of the original theorems.

The resulting theorems are intended to be simply universally
quantified equations, and theorems which are not of this form are discarded.
Rewriting attempts to instantiate some or all of the
universally quantified variables, or any type variables (which do
not appear in the assumptions), so as to
to match the left-hand side of an equation to the term being rewritten.
N.b. free variables are not instantiated.
An equation whose left-hand side matches the term being rewritten
in such a way that rewriting would not change the term
is treated as if it did not match the term.
\item[eqm\_rule]
This equation matcher is mapped over the theorems resulting
from the canonicalisation to convert them into an equation context.
$thm\_eqn\_cxt$ is used if $Nil$ is supplied.
\item[traverse]
This is a conversional, which defines the traversal of term $t$ by the
rewriting conversion derived from $prim\_rewrite\_conv$'s other arguments.
\item [with$\_$eqn$\_$cxt]
This is additional equational context to be
added directly into the rewriting conversion net.
\item[with$\_$thms]
This is an additional set of theorems to be processed by $canon$
and the results used in added directly into the rewriting conversion net.
\end{description}
=USES
This is the basis of the primary rewriting tools, by varying the first four parameters.

$prim\_rewrite\_conv$ preprocesses its arguments in various ways.
The preprocessing for an argument
takes place as soon as that argument is supplied, so, for example,
the overhead of preprocessing $with\_eqn\_cxt$ need not be incurred in calls with
the same $with\_eqn\_cxt$ but different $with\_thms$.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Specialised Traversal Functions}
=DOC
val €REWRITE_MAP_C› : string -> CONV -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This conversional is an equivalent to $TOP\_MAP\_C$ (q.v.)
except that it warns the user if it failed to recompose the theorems from
the term it just traversed.

$REWRITE\_MAP\_C$ $conv$ $tm$ traverses $tm$ from its root node to its leaves.
It will repeat the application of $conv$, until failure,
on each subterm encountered en route.
It then descends through the sub-term that results from the repeated application of $conv$.
If the descent causes any change, on ``coming back out'' to the sub-term the conversional will attempt
to reapply $conv$, and if successful
will then (recursively) reapply $REWRITE\_MAP\_C$ $conv$
once more.
If $conv$ cannot be reapplied then the conversional continues
to ascend back to the root.

It traverses from left to right, though this should only matter for
conversions that work by side-effect.
It fails if the conversion is applied nowhere within the term.
=FAILURE
26001	no rewriting occurred
26003	no successful rewriting occurred, rewriting gave ill-formed results on some subterms
=TEX
It issues the following warning message if at any point it fails to recompose the theorems from
the subterm it just traversed, some successful rewriting occurs, and the flag ``$illformed\-\_rewrite\-\_warning$''
is true.
=FAILURE
26002	rewriting gave ill-formed results on some subterms
=TEX
Errors and warnings are from the area indicated by the string argument.
=ENDDOC
We must be careful to issue warning 26002 only once, as the problem may occur very many times in one rewriting.
We also no not mention the subterms involves, as there may be many of them.
=DOC
val €ONCE_MAP_WARN_C› : string -> CONV -> CONV;
=DESCRIBE
This is an equivalent to $ONCE\_MAP\_C$ (q.v.)
except that it warns the user if it failed to recompose the theorems from
the term it just traversed.

This traverses a term from the root node to its leaves,
attempting to apply its conversion argument.
If it successfully applies the conversion to any subterm
then it will not further traverse that subterm,
but will still continue on other branches.
If it fails to apply its conversion to a leaf, its functionality is equivalent to then applying $refl\_conv$.
It traverses from left to right, though this should only matter for
conversions that work by side-effect.
It will fail if the conversion succeeds nowhere in the tree,
or if the results of certain conversion applications are ill-formed.
=FAILURE
26001	no rewriting occurred
26003	no successful rewriting occurred, rewriting gave ill-formed results on some subterms
=TEX
It issues the following warning message if at any point it fails to recompose the theorems from
the subterm it just traversed, some successful rewriting occurs, and the flag ``$illformed\-\_rewrite\-\_warning$''
is true.
=FAILURE
26002	rewriting gave ill-formed results on some subterms
=TEX
Errors and warnings are from the area indicated by the string argument.
=ENDDOC
We must be careful to issue warning 26002 only once, as the problem may occur very many times in one rewriting.
We also do not mention the subterms involves, as there may be many of them.
An example where this message will be given is:
=GFT Example
:> push_goal([¨b:'a = aÆ],¨T ± µ a : 'a ∑ f a (b:'a) ± TÆ);

Tactic produced 1 subgoal:

(* *** Goal "" *** *)

(*  1 *)  ¨b = aÆ

(* ?Ù *)  ¨µ a∑ f a b ± TÆ
=TEX
Notice how the inner $... ±\ T$ was not rewritten: this is
because rewriting with the assumption $¨b = aÆ$ worked on the subterm $¨bÆ$, but later caused a failure when that result was then wrapped with the universal quantifier,
and so \underline{all} the rewriting on that subterm was discarded.

(* "€illformed_rewrite_warning›" *)
=DESCRIBE
This flag modifies the behaviour of
$REWRITE\-\_MAP\-\_C$ and $ONCE\-\_MAP\-\_WARN\-\_C$.
When false (its default) it will not warn of illformed rewriting in subterms, with message 26002, though if no other rewriting occurs
then error message 26003 will still be used.
If true, then the warning will be given if some rewriting
is successful, but elsewhere it is illformed.

These are the standard rewriting rules.
They use the canonicalisation rule held by the proof context (see, e.g, $push\-\_pc$)
to
preprocess the theorem list.
The context is accessed at the point when the rules are given a list of
theorems.

If a rule is ``pure'' then there is no default rewriting,
otherwise the default rewriting conversion net
held by the proof context will be used
in addition to user supplied material.

If a rule is ``once'' then rewriting will proceed from the root
of the of the conclusion of the theorem to be rewritten, towards the leaves,
and will not descend through any rewritten subterm, using $ONCE\-\_MAP\-\_WARN\-\_C$.
If not, rewriting will continue, moving from the root to the leaves, repeating if any rewriting is successful, until there is no rewriting redex
anywhere within the rewritten conclusion, using $REWRITE\-\_MAP\-\_C$.
This may cause non-terminating looping.

If a rule is ``asm'' then the theorems rewritten with will include
the canonicalised $asm\_rule$d assumptions of the theorem being rewritten.

These are the rewriting tactics.
They use the canonicalisation rule held by the current proof context (see, e.g., $push\-\_pc$)
to
preprocess the theorem list.
The context is accessed at the point when the rules are given a list of
theorems.

If a tactic is ``pure'' then there is no default rewriting,
otherwise the default rewriting conversion net
held by the current proof context will be used
in addition to user supplied material.

If a tactic is ``once'' then rewriting will proceed from the root
of the of the conclusion of the theorem to be rewritten, towards the leaves,

=DESCRIBE
These are rewriting tactics parameterised to take only one theorem.
This parameterisation is convenient to use with the many tactic
generating functions, such as $LEMMA\_T$, which take a theorem tactic
as an argument.

See, e.g. $rewrite\_tac$ for the details of the differences
between these tactics.
=FAILURE
26001	no rewriting occurred
=FAILUREC
Errors will be reported as if they are from the corresponding $\_tac$:
e.g. from $rewrite\_tac$ rather than $rewrite\_thm\_tac$.
This allows a simple implementation, and for there to be
no functionality change even in errors between
using singleton lists with the originals, and these functions.
=FAILUREC
The following warning indicates the result of, perhaps only some, of the rewriting was discarded.
