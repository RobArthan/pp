\chapter{ABOUT THIS PUBLICATION} \label{intro}
\section{Purpose}

This document, one of several making up the user documentation for the \Product\ system,  contains a tutorial on the use of \Product\ for specification and proof in Higher Order Logic ({\hol}).

The objectives of this tutorial are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
to describe the basic principles and concepts underlying ProofPower
\item
to enable the student to write simple specifications and undertake elementary proofs in {\hol} using ProofPower
\item
to enable the student to make effective use of the reference documentation 
\end{itemize}

\section{Readership}

This document is intended to be among the first to be read by new users of {\Product}, and is designed either for use with the {\Product} {\hol} course, or for independent self tuition.

\section{Related Publications}

A bibliography is given at the end of this document.  Publications relating specifically to {\Product} are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em \ {\TUTORIAL}};
\item {\em \ {\ZTUTORIAL}};
\item {\em \ {\DESCRIPTION}};
\item {\em \ {\REFERENCE}};
\item {\em \ {\INSTALLATION}};
\item {\em \ {\TYPESETTING}}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Area Covered}

This document consists of notes appropriate for the introductory \ProductHOL\ course, which gives an idea of the way \Product\ is used for checking specifications and conducting proofs in {\ProductHOL}.

After working through  this tutorial, the reader should be capable of using {\Product} with {\ProductHOL} for simple tasks, and should be able to make effective use of the {\Product} documentation where necessary for approaching more difficult problems.

The tutorial should enable users of \Product\ to become familiar with the following subjects:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
The dialect of {\hol} supported by the \Product\ system (which we call {\ProductHOL}) and its manipulation via the metalanguage.
\item
Forward proof and derived rules of inference.
\item
Goal directed proof, tactics and tacticals.
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\section{Prerequisites}

Prior acquaintance with first order predicate logic and a functional programming language would be an advantage.

Some familiarity with:
\begin{itemize}
\item
first order predicate calculus
=GFT
¬(µx· P x ´ R x) ´ ((µ x· P x) ´ (µx· R x))®;
=TEX
\item
elementary set theory
=GFT
¬µa b c· a ¡ (b ¡ c) = (a ¡ b) ¡ c®;
=TEX
\item
functional programming
=SML
fun	fact 0 = 1
|	fact n = n * (fact (n - 1));
=TEX
\end{itemize}

A suitable text for an introduction to the predicate calculus and elementary set theory is {\it Software Engineering Mathematics} \cite{woodcock88}.
A good account of Standard ML may be found in {\it ML for the Working Programmer} \cite{paulson91}.


\section{How To Use This Tutorial}

It is hoped that this document enables {\Product} users who have not attended the {\Product-HOL} course to work through the course material independently.
In that case the material could be read in conjunction with the course OHP transparencies \cite{ds/fmu/ied/usr022}.

The best way to learn about {\Product} is by doing things with it.

The two kinds of things which you can do while working through these tutorial notes are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
do the set exercises
\item
replay the illustrative material (with optional variations)
\end{itemize}

In both of these the source documents are invaluable, and should be loaded into a texteditor and used by copy-and-paste.

Two alternative approaches to working through the material are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Follow the OHP transparencies.

Consulting the notes as necessary for further information, while using copy-and-paste on the OHP source file ({\tt usr022_slides.doc}) to replay the illustrations and do the exercises.

\item
Ignore the transparencies.

Work through the tutorial notes and the exercises as presented in this document.
There are several source documents which have names of the form usr013?.doc, usr013S.doc contains the source of the exercises chapter and usr013S.doc contains the solutions to the exercises.

\end{itemize}

In either case it is best to build up your own document containing your solutions to the exercises and any experiments you might wish to undertake.
{\Product} does not keep any record of what you type into it, and so if you want to do it again you will need to keep a copy of your script.

The source of these overheads is also supplied with {\Product} and a great deal of typing can be saved in doing the exercises if material is cut-and-pasted from the OHP source documents.

\chapter{KEYBOARD}\label{Keyboard}
{\ShowAllImages
The diagram below shows a representative Sun 4 keyboard.
On each key is shown the following information: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Top left: The main engraving on the
key. 
\item Top right: The name of any keyboard accelerator associated with the
key.  
\item Line beginning {\tt M} : The character resulting from the key when pressed together with the META key.
The META key itself is that shown with the main engraving $\diamond$ in the diagram below.
\item Line beginning {\tt +S} : The character resulting from the key when pressed together with the META and SHIFT keys.
\item Line beginning {\tt +C} : The character resulting from the key when pressed together with the META and CONTROL keys.
\end{itemize}

Thus, META+`{\tt W}' yields ``\PrPH'',
META+SHIFT+`{\tt W}' yields ``\PrNH'' and META+CONTROL+`{\tt W}' yields
``\PrJH''. {} Enclosing a character in parentheses indicates that
it is not returned when keyboard accelerators are active. Note that some combinations, for example META+CONTROL+`{\tt E}',are shown as a solid bar which
indicates that there is no extended character assigned to that combination. }
