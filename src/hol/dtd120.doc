\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Scope}
This document gives the detailed design for a higher-order matching function and
derived rules, conversions and tactics that exploit it.

\subsection{Purpose and Background}
See \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD011}.


\section{THE SIGNATURE}

\subsubsection{Prologue}
=SML
signature ÛHigherOrderMatchingÝ = sig
=TEX
\subsection{The Matcher}
=DOC
val Ûho_matchÝ : TERM -> TERM ->
	(TYPE * TYPE) list * (TERM * TERM)list;
=DESCRIBE
$ho\_match$ implements the higher-order matching algorithm of
Miller and Nipkow.
$term\_match$ $t$ $p$ attempts to find type and term instantiations
under which $p$ becomes $\alpha\beta\eta$-equivalent to $t$.
The algorithm is a decision procedure for this problem in
the case when $p$ is a linear pattern,
i.e., $p$ contains no Â-redexes and
for each free variable $v$ of $p$ there is an $n$ such that
each occurrence of $v$ is in a subterm of the form
$v\,x\sb{1}\ldots x\sb{n}$ where the $x_i$ are distinct bound variables
and where this subterm does not itself occur as the function in a function application (i.e., it is either the argument of a function application
or the body of a $\lambda$-abstraction).
The implementation does not check that $p$ is linear pattern but
will always fail rather than produce a pair of instantiations
that do not make $p$ $\alpha\beta\eta$-equivalent to $t$.

For example,
=GFT
ho_match ¬µx· x < 1® ¬µx:'a· P x® =
	([(”î®, ”'a®)], [(¬Ì x· x < 1®, ¬P:î ­ BOOL®)])
ho_match ¬µx· x < 1® ¬µx:'a· P x y® =
	([(”î®, ”'a®)], [(¬Ì x (y:'b)· x < 1®, ¬P:î ­ 'b ­ BOOL®)])
=TEX
Trivial associations (i.e. $(x,x)$) are omitted from the association lists returned by $ho\_match$.
=FAILURE
120001	?0 is not a higher-order instance of ?1
