\section{GENERAL}

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Scope}

This document contains the HOL pretty printing routines for the ICL HOL
system.  The high-level design for this document
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD008}.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Introduction}

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Purpose and Background}

The desired attributes of the pretty printer subsystem are defined in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD002} and further elaborated in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD008}.  This document contains the pretty printing
functions that are specific to the HOL concrete syntax
defined in~cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF001}.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Dependencies}

Basic output mechanisms are provided by the Oppen style printing
routines in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP024} and by the PolyML function
$PolyML.install_pp$, although they are provided via the pretty printer
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP025}.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Interface}

There is only one visible interfaces to this structure, namely that for
formatting HOL types.

Most of this structure is concerned with installing functions into the
pretty printer of~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP031}.  These functions are
thereafter are only called by that pretty printer.
