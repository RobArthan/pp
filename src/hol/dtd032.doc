\section{GENERAL}

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Scope}

This document contains the HOL pretty printing routines for the ICL HOL
system.  The high-level design for this document
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD008}.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Introduction}

%********************************************************************

\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}

The desired attributes of the pretty printer subsystem are defined in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD002} and further elaborated in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD008}.  This document contains the pretty printing
functions that are specific to the HOL concrete syntax
defined in~cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF001}.

%********************************************************************

\subsubsection{Dependencies}

Basic output mechanisms are provided by the Oppen style printing
routines in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP024} and by the PolyML function
$PolyML.install_pp$, although they are provided via the pretty printer
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP025}.

%********************************************************************

\subsubsection{Interface}

There is only one visible interface to this structure, namely that for
formatting HOL types.

Most of this structure is concerned with installing functions into the
pretty printer of~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP031}.  These functions are
thereafter are only called by that pretty printer.

\section{TEST POLICY}

The HOL pretty printing functions functions are to be tested according
to the general criteria laid down in the quality
plan~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008}.  In the case of the HOL pretty printer
structure, i.e., this document, there are no interfaces that can be
readily tested without extensive supporting values.  Function
$main_type_pp$ is intended to be called with a values of type $PP_ENV$
containing the support values.  The real tests of this module are
contained with the tests of the ``pretty printer'',
see~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD025} and~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/MDT025}.
