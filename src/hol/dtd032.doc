\subsection{Changes Forecast}

Showing the types of variables and constants in terms.  There are
several usages of variables and constants where it would be useful to
add type information.

\begin{itemize}

\item Defining instances of variables in let terms.
\item Uses of constants as functions.
\item Uses of constants as operands of other constructs.
\item Uses of constants as prefix, infix or postfix operators.
\item Uses of free variables.

\end{itemize}

Some of these are relatively easy to achieve, however constraining the
output to
`give the minimal typing necessary to read back the term' is difficult
to achieve.  One way of approaching minimal typing would be to have a
prepass which marked uses of constants and free variables which require
typing together with the pretty printer always typing defining
instances of variables.

\subsection{Scope}

This document contains the HOL pretty printing routines for the ICL HOL
system.  The high-level design for this document
is
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD008}.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Introduction}

%********************************************************************

\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}

The desired attributes of the pretty printer subsystem are defined in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD002} and further elaborated in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD008}.  This document contains the pretty printing
functions that are specific to the HOL concrete syntax
defined in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF001}.

%********************************************************************

\subsubsection{Dependencies}

Basic output mechanisms are provided by the Oppen style printing
routines in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD024} and by the Poly/ML function
$PolyML.install_pp$, although they are provided via the pretty printer
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD025}.

%********************************************************************

\subsubsection{Interface}

A major interface to the HOL pretty printer is the format of the
terms that are printed.  This information is presented in
section~\ref{Printing}.

There is only one visible interface to this structure, namely that for
formatting HOL types.

Most of this structure is concerned with installing functions into the
pretty printer of~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD031}.  These functions are
thereafter only called by that pretty printer.

\section{LAYOUT OF HOL TYPES AND TERMS}
\label{Printing}

HOL types and terms are formatted according to the following rules.
First some general principles are given.  Second, details for each of the
concrete syntax forms from the HOL grammar of~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF001}
are given.

Section~\ref{OtherPossibilities} below discusses some aspects of
formatting HOL types and terms and in particular why certain other
approaches are not taken.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{General Rules}

Line breaking is only used on sub expressions that cannot fit
completely on a line, allowing for the indentation used.

Indentation is used to show expression nesting, the indentation step
interval is two characters.

The text of an expression will be printed in a rectangular area with
its first symbol normally in the top left hand corner.  In some cases
the first symbol may not be on the left hand edge of the rectangle,
this may occur when the preceding symbol is printed on the same line.
(It may also occur when the outermost part of the expression is printed
as a top-level Standard~ML expression --- this is a consequence of the
way that Poly/ML top-level expressions are printed.)

Line breaks are preferred before keywords and operators rather than
afterwards, thus the keywords and operators are placed on the left hand
edge of the rectangular area.  Keywords here include: `$if$', `$then$',
`$else$', `$let$', `$and$', `$in$', `$|$', etc.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Introduction to the Concrete Syntax}

In most cases an extract from the concrete syntax
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF001} is shown.  This is followed by a variation
of that concrete syntax that shows how the term or type (or part
thereof) is printed.  The variation is in several forms.

\begin{itemize}

\item Additional grammar productions.

\item Simplification of some productions.

\item Addition of meta-identifiers showing where the
	Oppen~\label{DS/FMU/IED/DTD024} blocks and possible line breaks
	are placed.

\end{itemize}

The extra meta-identifiers are as follows.

\begin{description}
\def\ITEM#1{\item[$#1$ ] }

\ITEM{BC_{\cal N} } Start a block where line breaks are consistently
	taken.  Add $\cal N$ spaces of extra indentation for the line
	breaks in this block.

\ITEM{BI_{\cal N} } Start a block where line breaks are inconsistently
	taken.  Add $\cal N$ spaces of extra indentation for the line
	breaks in this block.

\ITEM{END } Complete a block.

\ITEM{BREAK } A position where a line break may occur.

\end{description}

Line breaking and `$BREAK$'s are only relevant when an expression will
not fit in its entirity in the space left on the line where it is to
start being printed.  If the expression will fit then `$BREAK$'s are
ignored.  Line breaking is consistent when all `$BREAK$'s at the
outermost level of a block are converted to line breaks plus
appropriate indentation.  Inconsistent line breaking is when only some
of the `$BREAK$'s are converted to line breaks, in this case as much as
possible of the expression is added to the line being printed.  The
indentation inserted at a line break is the sum of the indentation
outside of the enclosing block plus the extra indentation for the
current block.

\bigskip

To illustrate the nature of consistent versus inconsistent line
breaking, consider the following term.

=GFT Example term
	a ± b ± c ± d ± e ± f
=TEX

Now suppose that this term is to be printed where there is insufficient
space to fit it on a single line and hence some line breaking is
necessary.  If this term were printed with inconsistent line breaks then
as much of it as can fit onto a line is printed on that line, then a
line break is made.  Following the rules given for infix operators (see
section~\ref{PrintingOperators} below) the line breaks are only made
before the infix operator symbol, thus the term might be formatted as
follows.

=GFT Inconsistent line breaks
	a ± b ± c ± d
	± e ± f
=TEX

However, the rules given for infix operators also state that consistent
line breaking is performed so the actual output would be as follows.

=GFT Consistent line breaks
	a
	± b
	± c
	± d
	± e
	± f
=TEX

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Omitted Concrete Syntax Items}

Some parts of the concrete syntax of~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF001} are not
shown in the sections below.  These items are covered by the bracket
insertion and elimination rules, see section~\ref{PrintingBrackets},
or the following paragraphs.

All of the terminal symbols in the HOL grammar which are used for
identifiers are covered under identifiers in
section~\ref{PrintingTypedIdentifiers} below.

Quotations of types and terms (HOL grammar terminal symbols `$AqTm$'
and `$AqTy$') in the input to the HOL system are not remembered in the
whole term, rather the quoted term is included directly.  Hence there
is nothing in the pretty printer for printing them.  However, quotations
are generated by the pretty printer for certain uses of identifiers,
see section~\ref{PrintingTypedIdentifiers}.

Grammar non terminal `$OTm$' is provided to help disambiguate the grammar.
For pretty printing it only affects the bracket insertion and elimination
rules, see section~\ref{PrintingBrackets}.

Variable structures (also called varstructs) have a syntax which is a
restricted form of term, namely nested applications of the infix comma
operator.  Hence varstructs are printed as terms.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Typed Identifiers}
\label{PrintingTypedIdentifiers}

This section covers the terminal symbols used for identifiers in HOL:
`{\em InTmOp}', `{\em InTyOp}', `{\em Name}', `{\em PreOp}' and `{\em PostOp}'. {} Also
covered is the explicit typing of these identifiers.

=GFT BNF Concrete syntax
Tm		=	Tm, `:`, Ty;
=TEX

=GFT BNF Printing
Tm		=	BC_2, Tm, BREAK, `:`, Ty, END;
=TEX

String and character literals are printed with the appropriate
quotation marks.

Complex names, those that do not obey the rules for simple HOL
identifiers, are printed in the escaped string form.

To preserve the original term, names from a `$mk_const$' expression for
which no constant has been declared are printed as ML quotations of a
`$mk_const$'.  Similarly, names from a `$mk_var$' expression for which
a constant has been declared are printed as ML quotations of a
`$mk_var$'.  In both cases the arguments are the name and a HOL
quotation of its type.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Types}

=GFT BNF Concrete syntax
Ty		=	Name
		|	AqTy
		|	Typars, Name
		|	Ty, InTyOp, Ty
		|	`(`, Ty, `)`;
Typars		=	Ty
		|	`(`, Ty, { `,`, Ty }, `)`;
=TEX

There is no correspondence to `$AqTy$', the type quotation.  The
bracketting option to `$Ty$' is handled by the bracket insertion and
elimination rules, see section~\ref{PrintingBrackets}.  Infix type
constructors are discussed in section~\ref{PrintingOperators} and so
are not included immediately below.  Postfix
type constructors with one argument are printed differently from those
with several arguments.

=GFT BNF Printing
Ty		=	Name
		|	TyparsN;

TyparsN		=	Ty, BREAK, Name
		|	BI_0, `(`, BC_2, Ty, { `,`, BREAK, Ty },
				END, `)`, BREAK, Name, END;
=TEX

For details of the bracketing and line breaking rules for nested infix
type operators see section~\ref{PrintingBrackets}.

%********************************************************************
\newpage
\subsection{Binders}

=GFT BNF Concrete syntax
Tm		=	Binder, BndVars, `·`, Tm;

BndVars	=	Block, {`;`, Block };
Block		=	V1, { V1 }, [ `:`, Ty ];

V1		= 	Name	|	`(`, V, { `,`, V }, `)`;
=TEX

Nested binders with the same identifier are elided so that all the
bound variables are printed in a single `$BndVars$'.

=GFT BNF Printing
Tm		=	BC_0, Binder, BndVars, BREAK, `·`, BC_2, Tm, END, END;
=TEX

If control flag $pp_types_on_binders$ indicates that types are to be
shown on the bound varstructs (the `$V1$' in the grammar) then these
varstructs are gathered into blocks having the same type.  Each of
these blocks is printed followed by its type.  Blocks are separated by
semicolons.  In this case the grammar used is:

=GFT BNF Printing
BndVars	=	BC_2, BlockAA, {`;`, BREAK, END, BC_2, BlockAA }, END;
BlockAA	=	BI_0, Block, END;
=TEX

If types are not to be shown then the varstructs are printed
separated by spaces.  In this case the grammar used is:

=GFT BNF Printing
BndVars	=	BI_2, Block, END;
=TEX

The `$Block$' is common to both binder styles.

=GFT BNF Printing
Block		=	V1, { V1 }, [ BREAK, `:`, Ty ];

V1		= 	BREAK, BC_2, Tm, END;
=TEX

Each varstruct is printed as a term rather than having specific
rules to match the `$V1$' concrete syntax production.

%********************************************************************
\newpage
\subsection{Let Clauses}

The syntax of let clauses in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF001} is more
restrictive than that allowed by the implementation which additionally
allows local infix, prefix and postfix operators to be declared using
their infix, prefix and postfix forms.  For example, the following is
an excerpt from a run of the HOL system:

=GFT HOL Example
:> declare_infix(300, "e");
val it = () : unit
:> ¬let a e b = c in d e f®;
val it = ¬let a e b = c in d e f® : TERM
:> strip_let it;
val it = ([[(¬$e®, ¬Ì a b· c®)]], ¬d e f®) : (TERM * TERM) list list * TERM
:> dest_simple_term(snd it);
val it = App (¬$e d®, ¬f®) : DEST_SIMPLE_TERM
=TEX

\bigskip

=GFT BNF Concrete syntax
Tm		=	`let`, L, { `and`, L }, `in`, Tm;
L		=	Vs `=`, Tm;
Vs		=	V
		|	Name, V1s;
V1s		=	V1
		|	V1s, V1;
=TEX

The components of the `$L$' clause are assembled into a term for
printing.  The form of this term depends on `$pp_let_as_lambda$', a
boolean control flag.  When false, the default, local functions are
printed with their arguments on the left hand of the equality (in this
case the non terminal `$Vs$' is treated as a term denoting functional
application or operator application.  When true, local functions are
printed as lambda expressions.

=GFT BNF Printing
Tm		=	BI_2, BC_0, TmLetLet, { TmLetAnd }, END, BREAK,
					`in`, BC_0, Tm, END, END;
TmLetLet	=		BC_2, `let`, Tm, END;
TmLetAnd	=	BREAK,	BC_2, `and`, Tm, END;
=TEX

The aim here is that if the let expression does not fit on a line then
a line break is placed before the `$in$' keyword.  If the defining
clauses do not all fit on a line then additional line breaks are made
between the defining clauses, before the word `$and$'.

%********************************************************************
\newpage
\subsection{Conditionals}

=GFT BNF Concrete syntax
Tm		=	`if`, Tm, `then`, Tm, `else`, Tm;
=TEX

Cascaded conditionals are treated together as if their
concrete syntax is as follows.

=GFT BNF Effective Concrete syntax
Tm		=	`if`, Tm, `then`, Tm,
			{ `else if`, Tm, `then`, Tm },
			`else`, Tm;
=TEX

=GFT BNF Printing
Tm		=	BC_0,
			CIfPart, CThenPart,
			{ CElseIfPart, CThenPart },
			CElsePart,
			END;
CIfPart		=	BI_2, `if`,		CTm, END, BREAK;
CThenPart	=	BI_2, `then`,		CTm, END, BREAK;
CElseIfPart	=	BI_2, `else if`,	CTm, END, BREAK;
CElsePart	=	BI_2, `else`,		CTm, END;
CTm		=	BREAK, BC_0, Tm, END;
=TEX

Here the intention is that if the conditional does not fit on one line
then the component terms, each with its leading keyword, are on
separate lines.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Functional Application}

=GFT BNF Concrete syntax
Tm		=	Tm, Tm
=TEX

In functional applications the whole set of curried arguments are
gathered together, rather than treating it recursively through the left
hand argument.  Thus in the term `$f\;a\;b\;c\;d$' (which is the same
as `$(((f\;a)\;b)\;c)\;d$') the arguments `$a$', `$b$', `$c$' and `$d$'
are gathered and these four terms are considered to be the arguments of
the functional application.  Thus the effective concrete syntax is as
follows.

=GFT BNF Effective Concrete syntax
Tm		=	Tm, Tm, { Tm };
=TEX

=GFT BNF Printing
Tm		=	BC_2, BC_0, Tm, { END, BREAK, BC_2, Tm }, END, END;
=TEX

The intention here is that the arguments are indented from the
function.  If possible the whole application is printed on one line,
otherwise each part (i.e., function and arguments) is placed on
separate lines with the arguments indented from the function.

%********************************************************************
\newpage
\subsection{Lists and Set}

=GFT BNF Concrete syntax
Tm		=	`[`, OptTms, `]`;

Tm		=	`{`, OptTms, `}`;
Tm		=	`{`, V, `|`, Tm, `}`;

OptTms 	=	[ Tm, { `;`, Tm } ];
=TEX

The varstruct in the set comprehension is printed as a term.

=GFT BNF Printing
Tm		=	BI_0, `[`, OptTms, `]`, END;
Tm		=	BI_0, `{`, OptTms, `}`, END;

Tm		=	BI_0, `{`, BC_2,  Tm, END, BREAK, `|`,
				BC_2, Tm, END, `}`, END;

OptTms 	=	[ BC_2, Tm, { `;`, END, BREAK, BC_2, Tm }, END ];
=TEX

Enumerated lists and sets are printed fitting as much as
possible onto each line.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Infix, Prefix and Postfix Operators}
\label{PrintingOperators}

These operators are right associative thus, for example,
the following terms are equivalent.

=GFT
¬(a ± b) ± (c ± d)®
¬(a ± b) ± c ± d®
=TEX

Prefix and postfix operators associate in a similar manner.

=GFT BNF Concrete syntax
OTm		=	Tm, InTmOp, Tm
		|	PreOp, Tm
		|	Tm, PostOp;

Ty		=	Ty, InTyOp, Ty;
=TEX

When pretty printing a term containing several uses of the same
operator the intention is to avoid indenting for each sub expression.
In the following term all of the brackets may be omitted (because the
operators are right associative).

=GFT
¬a ± (b ± (c ± (d ± (e ± f))))®
=TEX

\label{AboutOperChain}
However, each pair of brackets indicates a sub expression of the whole
term.  A chain of infix operator applications like this example will be
printed according to the repetition infix operator rules in the
BNF-printing grammar below --- note that the repetition will have at
least one occurrence.  The rule for detection of these chains is as
follows.  Check for: (1)~the outermost structure of a sub expression is
an infix operator application; (2)~this sub expression is the operand
of an infix operator application; (3)~the two operators have the same
precedence; and, (4)~brackets are not required because of the
associativity of these operators.  When these four conditions all hold
a chain is formed.

Similar rules are used for forming chains of prefix plus postfix
operator applications --- this means there are two chain forms, one for
infix, one for prefix and postfix.

Operators in a chain all have the same precedence, but not necessarily
the same name.

=GFT BNF Printing

\subsection{Pairs and Tuples}

Printing pairs and tuples is mostly about getting the brackets
correct.  Pairs and tuples are formed by applications of the infix
comma `$,$' operator, however they are not printed according to the
rules in section~\ref{PrintingOperators} for other infix operators.

\subsection{Printing Brackets}
\label{PrintingBrackets}

Bracket insertion and elimination uses a scheme based upon precedence
levels which are determined from the HOL concrete
syntax~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF001}.  The precedences of infix, prefix and
postfix operators forms only part of the full range of precedence
levels used.  Precedence levels are encoded in type $PREC_CONTEXT$
of~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD031}.

Each production in the concrete syntax construct for a HOL type or term
is given a precedence level, each position where a term or type may
occur with the syntax is also given a precedence level.  Brackets are
output only when a comparison of these precedence levels shows that
they are needed.  The precedence levels are chosen so that most of the
unnecessary brackets are eliminated.  The word `most' is correct in the
previous sentence, brackets are inserted in a small number of cases
where, strictly speaking, they are not necessary.  This is done partly
to present output which is easier to read and partly because a much
more complex algorithm would be needed to determine when some brackets
were unnecessary.

As an example of a case which requires a complex algorithm to determine
whether brackets are necessary, all but one pair of brackets may be
removed from the following HOL term, it does not matter which pair is
retained.  If the `{\tt if}' term were replaced with a variable then all of
the brackets may be removed.  The distinction may only be found when
the `{\tt if}' is recognised.  Note that the operator `$±$' binds more
tightly than the `$²$' in this term.

=GFT HOL example
	¬ (a ± (b ± (c ± (d ± (e ± (if f then g else h)))))) ² i ®
=TEX

The problem comes from the HOL syntax rule that if terms extend as
far to the right as possible.  Similar problems occur with binder
and `{\tt let}' terms.  The solution adopted is to set the precedences
so that `{\tt if}' terms (also binder and `{\tt let}' terms, for the
same reason) are always bracketed when used as arguments to infix
operators.  Thus, brackets are always printed in the following terms,
even though they are unnecessary in the second term.

=GFT HOL examples
	¬ (if a1 then a2 else a3) ² b ®
	¬ a ² (if b1 then b2 else b3) ®
	¬ (if a1 then a2 else a3) ² b ± c ®
	¬ a ² (if b1 then b2 else b3) ± c ®
=TEX

Precedences are ordered in the same way as in the concrete
syntax.  ``High'' precedences bind more tightly than ``low''
precedences.  Each concrete syntax production (not the actual concrete
syntax of~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF001}, rather an idealised syntax that
allows for the extra brackets that are inserted) is given a particular
precedence level, if it is used in a higher precedence context then it
must be enclosed in round brackets.  The round brackets themselves
require the highest precedence level, thus round brackets never need to
be enclosed in round brackets.  The context within round brackets is
the lowest precedence level allowing any other concrete syntax
production to be used without brackets.

Precedences of the other concrete syntax productions are
generally simple to decide.  All the self-bracketing forms require
highest precedence and enclose the lowest.

An extra-low precedence is needed for HOL pairs and tuples where
brackets are always required.  These values are formed using the infix
comma as an operator, tuples may be formed by nesting pairs, the comma
is right associative allowing some brackets to be eliminated.  Having
an extra precedence below the normal lowest level allows the general
bracket elimination mechanism to be used to insert only those brackets
that are necessary.

\subsection{Printing Incomplete Terms}

The integer controls $pp_top_level_depth$ and $pp_format_depth$
of~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD025} allow the printing of only the outermost
levels of a HOL term or type.  These controls are interpreted as
follows.

\begin{enumerate}

\item The outermost concrete syntax production of a HOL term or type is
	at a depth of one.

\item At each recursion through the non terminals $Tm$ and $Ty$ in the
	HOL grammar (actually: the HOL grammar used for printing) the
	depth increases by one.

\item After each of the following items in iterative parts of the HOL
	grammar the depth increases by one.

	\begin{itemize}

	\item The semicolon in production $OptTms$ of list and set
		displays.

	\item The comma in production $Typars$ of type parameters.

	\item Function and arguments of a functional application.

	\item The semicolon in production $BndVars$ of binders.

	\item The varstruct in production $V1$ of binders.

	\item The `$else\;if$' clauses in conditionals.

	\item The commas in paired abstractions.

	\end{itemize}

	These increases accumulate during the iteration thus, for
	example, if the first element of a list had a depth of five
	then the second has depth six and the~$\cal N$-th has depth
	of~$\cal N+4$.

\item If the depth of a term or type exceeds the depth specified
	in the controls then it is printed as three dots.

\end{enumerate}

Note that these rules mean that in some cases two adjacent sets of
three dots are printed, one represents a suppressed expression the
other a suppressed list continuation.

\subsection{Indentation and Line Widths}

The treatment of large or complex HOL terms and types which require a
large amount of indentation depends upon where they are printed.

When HOL terms and types are printed as part of Standard~ML top-level
expressions the indentation actually given and the line width available
is as provided by the Poly/ML pretty printing system.  The indentation
requested for the HOL parts of the top-level expressions is as
described in the rest of this document.  From observation, Poly/ML
gives as much indentation as is necessary to show the structure of an
expression and it tends to place one token per line when the
indentation exceeds a fixed line width of~80 characters.

When HOL terms and types are printed via the `$format_\ldots$' routines
in structure $PrettyPrinter$ of~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD025} the actual
indentation and line width used is as provided by the Oppen formatting
routines of~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD024}.  In this case if the indentation
required for a term exceeds three quarters of the desired line width
then the indentation point is moved back to the left hand margin by
that width and the available line width correspondingly increased.
Thus some lines within the rectangular area discussed above may be
`slid' left by three quarters of the line width.  The amount of
indentation used for a line is, effectively, the indentation
appropriate for that line based upon the rules elsewhere in this
document, modulo three quarters of the desired line width.  The space
available for tokens is always the space between the actual indentation
used and the desired line width.  When the width of a token plus the
actual indentation used exceeds the desired line width, the token will
be printed on a line extending past the desired line width.

Note that a `token' in this section indicates any string of characters
generated by the BNF-printing rules and which occur between the
`$BREAK$' symbols.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Other Possibilities}
\label{OtherPossibilities}

There are many possibly variations on the above formatting rules, this
section explains a small number of them and why they are not used.

\begin{itemize}

\item Operators, primarily infix ones, might have consistent versus
	inconsistent line breaking selected based on the operator's
	precedence, the high precedence (tightly binding) operators
	having inconsistent line breaking.  The problem here is that a
	term formed from a chain (see section~\ref{AboutOperChain} for
	details of chains) of a high precedence operator where many of
	the operands are themselves complex terms will be printed in a
	way that hides the chain structure of the term.   Contrast this
	with a chain of a low precedence operator with complex operands
	when the operands each start on separate lines.

\item The first symbol of an expression might be forced to occupy the
	top left hand corner of a rectangular area of the output.  This
	area might be formed by remembering the horizontal position of
	the start symbol and using this of subsequent lines of the
	rectangular area.  Unfortunately, the Oppen formatting
	system does not provide any way of remembering an indentation
	point.  Alternatively, we might force a line break at the start
	of each rectangular area.  However this would mean that the
	formatted terms occupy an excessive number of lines, many of
	which contain a single symbol.

\end{itemize}

\section{TEST POLICY}

The HOL pretty printing functions are to be tested according
to the general criteria laid down in the quality
plan~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008}.  In the case of the HOL pretty printer
structure, i.e., this document, there are no interfaces that can be
readily tested without extensive supporting values.  Function
$main_type_pp$ is intended to be called with a values of type $PP_ENV$
containing the support values.  The real tests of this module are
contained with the tests of the ``pretty printer'',
see~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD025} and~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/MDT025}.
