\subsection{Introduction}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}

We are concerned with supplying \Product{} with some simple facilities
to assist with equational reasoning.  There is an enormous body of
theory concerning rewrite systems, but we are only concerned with a
small and elementary part of it.  No doubt, more advanced techniques
such as the Knuth-Bendix completion algorithm could be of benefit in
\Product.  However, many problems which arise in practice require
nothing more than a more sophisticated approach to using equations
which are not quantified (i.e., from the point of view of the usual
theory of rewrite systems the variables in them act as constants).

As an example of a typical problem which requires more human
intervention than one would like, consider proving $x = y$ on the basis
of the equations $a = b$, $a = y$, and $b = x$. Without the sort of
support supplied in this document, this, while not difficult to do
requires some little thought.  Our main algorithm, therefore, is a
\Product{} solution to the following problem.

The proof procedures are implemented in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP084},
the module tests are in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD008}.

\paragraph{Decision Procedure for Quantifier-Free Rewriting}
Let
=INLINEFT
V = {vâ1, vâ2, ..., vâm}
=TEX
\ be a set of $m$ variables.
Given a system, á, of $k$ equations,
=INLINEFT
xâi = yâi
=TEX
, where the
=INLINEFT
xâi
=TEX
\ and
=INLINEFT
yâi
=TEX
\ are variables drawn from and exhausting $V$, find
a system, Ñ, of $m$ equations
=INLINEFT
vâi = zâi
=TEX
\ whose conjunction is logically equivalent to that
of á, and such that an equation
=INLINEFT
vâi = vâj
=TEX
\ is an equational consequence of á iff. the equations in Ñ for
=INLINEFT
vâi
=TEX
\ and
=INLINEFT
vâj
=TEX
\ have the same right hand side.  (Here we say an equation is an
equational consequence of á if  it can be derived from á using only
the reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity of equality).

It is not hard to see that this problem is essentially the same as the
problem ``given the edges of a graph find its connected components''
and the algorithm we use is a relatively straightforward adaptation of
the graph-searching algorithm which naturally suggests itself,
(essentially Warshall's algorithm for finding the transitive closure of
a relation, see, e.g., \cite{Bornat79}).  Moreover, the algorithm can
conveniently be packaged as a canonicalisation function used to process
rewrite rules in \Product.
Such a canonicalisation is included as part of functions $ASM_PROP_EQ_T$
and $PROP_EQ_T$ below.

This decision procedure may readily be extended to give a decision
procedure for propositional logic with equality, and this is precisely
how the automatic proof procedures in the proof context defined in this
document works. The decision procedure may be described, in abstract
terms, as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\vertbarfalse

\item
We are given a formulae, $A$ say, in the language of propositional
logic with equality. We can write $A$ as a conjunction of formulae of
the form:

=GFT
		Aâ1 ± Aâ2 ± ...  ¥  Bâ1 ≤ Bâ2 ≤ ...
=TEX

where the
=INLINEFT
Aâi
=TEX
\ and
=INLINEFT
Bâi
=TEX
\ are atomic formulae (i.e. equations between variables). Since $A$ is
provable iff.{} each of the conjuncts it is split into is
provable, we may assume without loss of
generality that $A$ has this form.


\item
We now apply the decision procedure for quantifier-free rewriting
to the equations
=INLINEFT
Aâi
=TEX
\ to give a system of equations,
=INLINEFT
Aâj'
=TEX
\ such that
=INLINEFT
Aâ1 ± Aâ2 ± ... § Aâ1' ± Aâ2' ± ...
=TEX
\ and such that for any equation, $a = b$, with $a$ and $b$ variables,
the formula
=INLINEFT
Aâ1' ± Aâ2' ± ... ¥ a = b
=TEX
\ is provable iff. the
=INLINEFT
Aâj'
=TEX
\ include equations of the form $a = x$ and $b = x$.
Let $A'$ be the formula:

=GFT
		Aâ1' ± Aâ2' ± ...  ¥  Bâ1 ≤ Bâ2 ≤ ...
=TEX

Then by the above remarks
=INLINEFT
A § A'
=TEX
.



\item
Now, using the fact that, for any formulae $C$ and variables $a$ and $b$,
=INLINEFT
Ù a = b ¥ C § a = b ¥ C[b/a]
=TEX
, we can prove
=INLINEFT
A' § A''
=TEX
, where $A''$ has the form:

=GFT
		Aâ1' ± Aâ2' ± ...  ¥  Bâ1' ≤ Bâ2' ≤ ...
=TEX

where, for each $i$, if 
=INLINEFT
Bâi
=TEX
\ is
=INLINEFT
v = u
=TEX
\ then
=INLINEFT
Bâi'
=TEX
\ is
=INLINEFT
v' = u'
=TEX
\ where $v'$ is $x$ if an equation
=INLINEFT
v' = x
=TEX
\ appears amongst the
=INLINEFT
Aâj'
=TEX
, and is $v$ otherwise, and similarly for $u'$.



\item
Now $A''$ is provable iff. some
=INLINEFT
Bâi'
=TEX
\ has the form
=INLINEFT
x = x
=TEX
, since {\em(i)} if some
=INLINEFT
Bâi'
=TEX
\ has this form then $A''$ is certainly provable by reflexivity, and
{\em(ii)} if no
=INLINEFT
Bâi'
=TEX
\ has this form, we can construct an interpretation, $I$, whose
universe is the set of all variables which appear either on the
right-hand side of some equation
=INLINEFT
Aâj'
=TEX
\ or on either side of some
=INLINEFT
Bâi'
=TEX
, and in which a variable $x$ is interpreted as $y$ if some
=INLINEFT
Aâj'
=TEX
\ is $x = y$, or as itself otherwise. Then $A''$, and so also $A$, is not
valid with respect to this interpretation, so $A$ cannot be provable.

\end{enumerate}


The good thing about the above procedure is that, given a
canonicalisation function acting as a decision procedure for
quantifier-free rewriting, its implementation in \Product{} is more
straightforward than the above description. The first step is little
more than
=INLINEFT
REPEAT strip_tac
=TEX
\, the rest is applying the canonicalisation function to the equational
assumptions and rewriting the other assumptions with the result.

This proof procedure may fail to prove some problems involving finite sets,
for example when there are more variables
=INLINEFT
zâi
=TEX
{} in the set
=INLINEFT
Ñ
=TEX
{} than there are values in the finite set.  In such cases there must be
at least one unstated equation of the form
=INLINEFT
zâi = zâj
=TEX
{} for some
=INLINEFT
i Ω j
=TEX
{} which may supply enough further information to yield a proof.
Consider, for example, the case when the set
=INLINEFT
Ñ
=TEX
{} has the values
=INLINEFT
zâ1
=TEX
,
=INLINEFT
zâ2
=TEX
{} and
=INLINEFT
zâ3
=TEX
{} as the right hand sides of its equations and these variables are
taken from a two-valued type.  In this case we can derive the
following information:

=GFT
		zâ1 = zâ2 ≤ zâ1 = zâ3 ≤ zâ2 = zâ3
=TEX

propositional calculus with equality.

=DOC
val €prop_eq_rule› : THM list -> THM list * THM list;
=DESCRIBE
Given a list of theorems with conclusions of the form %
=INLINEFT
¨ aâi = bâi Æ
=TEX
{} for various $aâi$ and $bâi$ this function produces a set of
theorems that equate all members of each equivalence class
determined by the equations to a common
value.  The equivalence classes are the sets of all $aâi$ and $bâi$
that are equated either directly or transitively, they comprise terms
that are $\alpha$-convertible rather than requiring strict equality.
For each of the equivalence classes a set of theorems equating each
term in the class to the ``simplest'' (see below) term in the class is
generated.  These new theorems have the simplest term as their right
hand comparand, duplicated theorems and identity theorems are
excluded.  The first list in the result tuple contains the new theorems
from all of the equivalence classes.  The second list in the result
tuple comprises all the argument theorems which were not equasions.  The
new theorems are intended to be used as arguments for a rewriting
operation.

The choice of the ``simplest'' term is intended to give the most useful
rewriting theorems and those which are least likely to loop.  HOL
constants are considered the most simple, variables next, then functional
applications, with lamdba abstractions considered the most complex.
A simple recursive counting function is used to traverse each term to
evaluate its complexity.  Function $term_order$ (q.v.) is used when the
counting function cannot decide.
=EXAMPLE
Applying this rule to a list of theorems with the following conclusions:

=GFT
	Ù a1=b1		Ù a1=c1		Ù d1=c1		Ù z1=x1
	Ù b1=y1		Ù z1=w1		Ù w1=y1		Ù c1=y1
	Ù a2=b2		Ù a2=c2		Ù d2=c2		Ù z2=x2
	Ù b2=y2		Ù z2=w2		Ù w2=y2		Ù c2=y2
	Ù x ± y
=TEX
will produce a list of theorems with the following conclusions
as the first element of the result tuple:

=GFT
	Ù x1=a1		Ù z1=a1		Ù w1=a1		Ù d1=a1
	Ù y1=a1		Ù b1=a1		Ù c1=a1
	Ù x2=a2		Ù z2=a2		Ù w2=a2		Ù d2=a2
	Ù y2=a2		Ù b2=a2		Ù c2=a2
=TEX
plus the non equational theorems s the second element of the result tuple.

\section{TACTICS AND TACTICALS}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
val €prop_eq_prove_tac› : THM list -> TACTIC;
=DESCRIBE
This tactic is suitable to be used as an automatic proof procedure in a
proof context, it aims to solve problems which may be solved by
reasoning in the propositional calculus with equality.

The tactic has the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}

\item It strips all of the assumptions, using the stripping functions
	of the current proof context, back into the assumptions.  More
	precisely, `$DROP_ASMS_T$ $(MAP_EVERY$ $strip_asm_tac)$' is
	used.

\item It applies $contr_tac$ to increase the stock of assumptions.

\item \label{PEPT084} It splits all of the assumptions into two groups,
	those which are equations and those which are not.

\item Using the equation assumptions and the given theorems, a new set
	of theorems is produced using $prop_eq_rule$ (q.v.) which
	equate all members of an equivalence classes to a common member
	of the class.

\item It rewrites all of the other assumptions with these new theorems
	and with the rewriting theorems of the current proof context.

\item It strips the rewritten assumptions and the equational
	assumptions from step~\ref{PEPT084} back into the goal.

\end{enumerate}

val €ASM_PROP_EQ_T› : (THM list -> TACTIC) -> THM list -> TACTIC
val €PROP_EQ_T› : (THM list -> TACTIC) -> THM list -> TACTIC
=DESCRIBE
These are theorem tacticals which process the argument theorems and
(for $ASM_PROP_EQ_T$) the
assumptions before calling the argument theorem tactic.  A call of
``$ASM_PROP_EQ_T\;thm_tac\;thms$'' takes $thms$ plus theorems
representing any equations from the assumptions, these are
cannonicalised by the rewriting canon of the current proof context,
then processed by $prop_eq_rule$ (q.v.) to form the arguments passed to
function $thm_tac$.  The order of the assumptions may be changed.
Tactical $PROP_EQ_T$ does not use the assumptions.

	val €pair_eq_conv› : CONV
=DESCRIBE
This conversion transforms equations involving pairs and the constants
$Fst$ and $Snd$ into new equations whose comparands have simpler types
by using the first match found in
the following rules:
=GFT
Fst(a,b) = x		≠	a = x
Snd(a,b) = y		≠	b = y
x = Fst(a,b)		≠	x = a
y = Snd(a,b)		≠	y = b

z = w			≠	Fst z = Fst w ± Snd z = Snd w
=TEX
=USES
The conversion is intended for use in tactic and conversion
programming.  It is usefully applied before using $prop_eq_prove_tac$
or $ASM_PROP_EQ_T$ (q.v.). {} The normal interactive interface is via
rewriting or stripping in the proof context $prop_eq_pair$ (q.v.).
