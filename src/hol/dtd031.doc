%********************************************************************

\subsection{Scope}

This document contains the pretty printer support structure for the ICL
HOL system.  The high-level design for this document
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD008}.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Introduction}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Purpose and Background}

The desired attributes of the pretty printer subsystem are defined in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD002} and further elaborated in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD008}.  This part of the pretty printer subsystem
hols the basic pretty printing routines.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

%\subsection{Dependencies}
%\subsection{Interface}
\subsection{Algorithms}

The basic pretty printing algorithm is a recursive descent through the
data structures holding the HOL term.  At each stage the outermost
structure of the term is destroyed and a suitable printing function
chosen.  The called function prints out various fixed strings and
spacing interleaved with the the subterms it is given.  These subterms
are printed by calling the outermost printing function.

Suitable printing functions are chosen based on the ``current
language'' or the language of the HOL constant being applied at the
outermost level of each recursive call.  A database of languages and
printing functions is held, and routines are provided in this structure
to access the database.

\section{LANGUAGE EMBEDDING INTERFACE}

Some extra interfaces are provided for adding printing functions
for embedded languages.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
datatype âPrec_Contextá
	=	âpc_highestá
	|	âpc_normalá		of int * int * bool
	|	âpc_lowestá
	|	âpc_very_lowá		of int * int * bool
	;
=DESCRIBE
Precedence levels used to help decide when brackets are necessary in
the generated text.  The levels are used as follows.

\begin{description}
\def\ITEM#1{\item[$#1$ ] }

\ITEM{pc_highest} Items which are self bracketing (e.g., HOL set
	displays which are enclosed by curly braces) bind most tightly,
	they have this high precedence, they do not need to be enclosed in
	round brackets.

\ITEM{pc_normal} Most of the precedences used are given with this
	constructor.

\ITEM{pc_lowest} The normal lowest precedence binds weakly, it is
	mostly used as an enclosing precedence (e.g., within round
	brackets or between the words `{\tt if}' and `{\tt then}' of a
	HOL conditional), it shows that any other language construct
	may be enclosed without the need for brackets.

\ITEM{pc_very_low} In some cases brackets must be added around a term,
	but multiple set of brackets are not wanted.  Having an extra
	precedence below $pc_lowest$ allows the general bracket
	elimination mechanism to be used to insert only those brackets
	that are necessary.  For generality the same arguments are
	provided as with $pc_normal$, they have the same
	interpretation.

\end{description}
=SEEALSO
Function $ge_prec$ for details of comparing these values.
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
val âge_precá : Prec_Context * Prec_Context -> bool;
(* infix ge_prec; *)
=DESCRIBE
Compares two precedences returning $true$ when the first (left hand)
argument is greater than or equal to the second.  Values of
$pc_highest$ are greater than $pc_normal$ which are greater than
$pc_lowest$ which are greater than $pc_very_low$.

With two values of $pc_normal$ the second integer is only used when the
first integers are the same.  The boolean is only used when the first
integers and the second integers are the same.  Normal integer
comparisons are used.  A suggested use of this three stage comparison
is to distinguish: (first integer) the area of the syntax; (second
integer) the precedence of an infix, prefix or postfix operator with
the syntax area for operators; and, (boolean) the associativity of the
operator.

Associativity comparisons are as follows: (assuming both pairs of
integers compared equal) if either of the booleans are $false$ then
brackets are not required, if both are $true$ then brackets are
required.

Two values of $pc_very_low$ are compared in the same way as
values of $pc_normal$.

For values where only the syntax area is of interest, the second
integer and the boolean should be set to zero and $false$.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
(* Flag âpp_add_bracketsá : boolean control, default false *)
=DESCRIBE
Controls the bracket elimination conventions in the pretty printer by
changing the way that function $ge_prec$ works.  When set to $true$
many brackets are included in the output, this is achieved by making
$ge_prec$ return $true$ more often.  The default (namely $false$) is to
eliminate most of the unnecessary brackets.  Note, the bracket
elimination conventions intentionally leave in some brackets where,
strictly, they are not needed.  The intention is to leave those
brackets that help in understanding the structure of the term or type.

When the flag is $true$ function $ge_prec$ returns $true$ whenever
its first argument is not $pc_lowest$, it returns $false$ otherwise.

datatype âPFUN_ANSá
	=	âpf_fewerá		of int
	|	âpf_not_possibleá
	|	âpf_oká
	;
=DESCRIBE
The result type of functions used to print out a function application
of a constant or variable  to a list of arguments, these are
components $pe_fun_const$ and $pe_fun_var$ of
datatype $PP_ENV$ below.  Value $pf_ok$ means that the application has
been output.  Value $pf_not_possible$ means that the application cannot
be printed by this function.  Value $pf_fewer$ means the function can
print out the application, but not with the given number of arguments,
the integer indicates how many arguments it could print.
