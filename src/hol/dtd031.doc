\section{GENERAL}

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Scope}

This document contains the pretty printer support structure for the ICL
HOL system.  The high-level design for this document
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD008}.

%********************************************************************

\subsection{Introduction}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}

The desired attributes of the pretty printer subsystem are defined in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD002} and further elaborated in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD008}.  This part of the pretty printer subsystem
hols the basic pretty printing routines.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

%\subsubsection{Dependencies}
%\subsubsection{Interface}
\subsubsection{Algorithms}

The basic pretty printing algorithm is a recursive descent through the
data structures holding the HOL term.  At each stage the outermost
structure of the term is destroyed and a suitable printing function
chosen.  The called function prints out various fixed strings and
spacing interleaved with the subterms it is given.  These subterms
are printed by calling the outermost printing function.

Suitable printing functions are chosen based on the ``current
language'' or the language of the HOL constant being applied at the
outermost level of each recursive call.  A database of languages and
printing functions is held, and routines are provided in this structure
to access the database.

\section{LANGUAGE EMBEDDING INTERFACE}

Some extra interfaces are provided for adding printing functions
for embedded languages.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
datatype ÛOP_PRECÝ
	=	ÛPcHighestÝ
	|	ÛPcNormalÝ		of int * int * Lex.ASSOC
	|	ÛPcLowestÝ
	;
type	ÛPREC_CONTEXTÝ = OP_PREC * Lex.ASSOC;
=DESCRIBE
These types are used in the pretty printing system.
Precedence levels are used to help decide when brackets are necessary in
the generated text.  The levels are used as follows.

\begin{description}
\def\ITEM#1{\item[$#1$ ] }

\ITEM{PcHighest} Items which are self bracketing (e.g., HOL set
	displays which are enclosed by curly braces) bind most tightly,
	they have this high precedence, they never need to be enclosed in
	round brackets.

\ITEM{PcNormal} Most of the precedences used are given with this
	constructor.

\ITEM{PcLowest} The normal lowest precedence binds weakly, it is
	mostly used as an enclosing precedence (e.g., within round
	brackets or between the words `{\tt if}' and `{\tt then}' of a
	HOL conditional), it shows that any other language construct
	may be enclosed without the need for brackets.

\end{description}
=SEEALSO
Function $gt_prec$ for details of comparing these values.
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

Function $gt_prec$ provides comparison of precedences, it is
conveniently declared as an infix operator within contexts that use
the pretty printer support structure.

A suggested use of this three stage comparison
is to distinguish: (first integer) the area of the syntax; (second
integer) the precedence of an infix, prefix or postfix operator with
the syntax area for operators; and, (boolean) the associativity of the
operator.

For values where only the syntax area is of interest, the second
integer and the boolean should be set to zero and $false$.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
val Ûgt_precÝ : PREC_CONTEXT * OP_PREC -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
Compares two precedences in context returning $true$ when the precedence of the first
argument (enclosing context) is higher than the second (enclosed precedence), i.e., when the enclosed item needs brackets.

When flag $pp_add_brackets$ is $true$ function $gt_prec$ returns $true$
iff. its first argument is not $PcLowest$.
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

Note, the bracket elimination conventions intentionally leave in some
brackets where, strictly, they are not needed.  The intention is to
leave those brackets that help in understanding the structure of the
term or type.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
(* Flag Ûpp_add_bracketsÝ : boolean control, default false *)
=DESCRIBE
Controls the bracket elimination conventions in the pretty printer.
When set to $true$ many brackets are included in the output.  The
default (namely $false$) is to
eliminate most of the unnecessary brackets.
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
(* Flag Ûpp_prefer_current_languageÝ : boolean control, default false *)
=DESCRIBE
When this flag is false, the pretty printer for terms only changes language when it is forced to do so; i.e., when a subterm is printed, if it can be printed without changing language, it will be.

When this flag is true, the pretty printer changes to the language of the current theory (as returned by $get\_current\_language$) whenever possible;
i.e., when a subterm is printed, if it can be printed using the language of the current theory, it will be.

datatype ÛPFUN_ANSÝ
	=	ÛPfFewerÝ		of int
	|	ÛPfNotPossibleÝ
	|	ÛPfOkÝ
	;
=DESCRIBE
This is a datatype used in the pretty printing system, it holds
the result type of functions used to print out a part of a term.
These are components $pe_fun_const$, $pe_fun_var$, $pe_app$,
$pe_const$, $pe_var$ and $pe_Ì$ of
datatype $PP_ENV$ below.  Value $PfOk$ means that the application has
been output.  Value $PfNotPossible$ means that the term cannot be
printed by this function.  Value $PfFewer$ means a term which is a
function application can
print out the application, but not with the given number of arguments,
the integer indicates how many arguments it could print.

};
=DESCRIBE
This is a datatype used in the pretty printing system, it holds
an environment value to be passed between the printing functions.

Elements $pe_Ì$, $pe_app$, $pe_const$, $pe_fun_const$,
$pe_fun_var$ and $pe_var$ are
the printing routines for the current language which is given by
$pe_lang$.

Elements $pe_addstring$, $pe_beginb$, $pe_endb$ and $pe_space$ are the
Oppen style printing routines to be used,
see~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP024}.
=ENDDOC

Several of the term printing functions contain a destroyed constant or
variable (the $string$ and $TYPE$) arguments, these functions have as
their first $TERM$ argument the original constant or variable.  The two
forms are closely related via the constructor or destructor functions.
Further explanation is given in the
list below which describes of all of the environment values.

\begin{description}
\def\ITEM#1{\item[$#1$ ] }

\ITEM{pe_depth} When $Nil$, terms are printed to their full extent.  An
	integer indicates the depth to which terms are printed.  A
	non-positive value indicates stop printing.  This field is
	decremented by $main_term_pp$ before it calls any printing routine.
	These routines may inspect the field to determine how to do
	their work, but they should print something (or call
	$main_term_pp$ recursively) when the field is $Nil$, zero or
	positive.  Printing routines may alter this field (function
	$decrement_depth$ is recommended) to reflect expression nesting
	that is not detected by $main_term_pp$; for example, with a
	list the printing routine might gather all the list members
	then call $main_term_pp$ for each, it may be desirable to print
	only the first few (i.e., $pe_depth$) members of the list.

\ITEM{pe_prec} The enclosing precedence context provided by the calling
	printing function.  This is used as the left hand argument of
	function $gt_prec$.

\ITEM{pe_show_index} Indicates that the `top level' identifier in the
	term or type should be enclosed in index bracket characters.
	The definition of `top level' is left to the printing functions
	and so they should clear the flag (via function
	$set_show_index$ below) before printing any lower level parts
	of the type or term.

\ITEM{pe_lang} The pretty printer's idea of the language currently
	being printed.

\ITEM{pe_fun_const, pe_fun_var} The functions for printing function
	applications of constants and variables, respectively, in the current
	language.  The first term value is the constant or variable;
	the string and type are from its destroyed form; the
	string is the constant or variable name.
	The term list holds the arguments that the constant
	or variable is applied to.  The original term may be recreated
	by $list_mk_app$ applied to the term and the term list.

\ITEM{pe_const, pe_var} Two of the four functions for printing the
	basic HOL term types in the current language.  The term value
	is the constant or variable, the string and type are from its
	destroyed form after aliases are found.

\ITEM{pe_app, pe_Ì} The remaining two functions for printing the
	basic HOL term types in the current language, although the
	application form is generalised to allow a list of arguments.

\item A value of type $PFUN_ANS$ is returned by the preceeding four
	functions.  It has the same general meaning as if it were
	returned by the functions $pe_fun_const$ or $pe_fun_var$,
	however a value of $PfFewer$ is interpreted as if it were
	$PfNotPossible$, both are taken to mean that the term cannot be
	printed.  If the current language (as held in $pe_lang$) is
	``HOL'' then an error is declared, otherwise the HOL language
	is set and the corresponding ``HOL'' function invoked.

\ITEM{pe_addstring, pe_beginb, pe_endb, pe_space} The Oppen printing
	functions to be used, see~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP024}.

printing functions call this function to print the sub terms of the
term they were given.
If called when $pe_depth$ of the first argument is negative or zero the
string ``\verb*|... |'' is printed (``\verb*| |'' denotes a space).
When this function calls any printing routine it sets $pe_depth$ field
to one less than its entry value.

=FAILUREC
Error 31003 denotes that neither the pretty printer for the current
language in the $PP_ENV$ nor the pretty printer for HOL could print
part of the given term.  The design of the HOL printing routines should
ensure that this error never happens.

val Ûchoose_const_languageÝ : string * string list -> string;
=DESCRIBE
Identifies the language to be used for printing a term based on the
name of a constant given as the first argument.  Function
$get_const_language$ gives a set of candidate languages for the
constant.  The preferred languages are given by the second argument.
The first preferred language that is also a candidate will be
returned.  If no preferred language is a candidate matches then the
head element of the candidates will be returned.  Finally, the current
language (as given by $get_current_language$) is chosen if nothing else
is appropriate.
=SEEALSO
get_const_language, get_current_language
=ENDDOC
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that function $get_const_language$ will return the current
language (as returned by function $get_current_language$) for unknown
constants, so the last sentence of the descriptions of the two
$choose_\ldots_language$ functions is superfluous, however it is useful
as it conveys the actions of these  routines in the case of unknown
constants without the reader needing to refer to the description of
$get_const_language$.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
=DOC
val Ûchoose_term_languageÝ : TERM * string list -> string;
=DESCRIBE
Identifies the language to be used for printing a term.  The choice is
based upon the outermost construct in the term: if it is a constant
applied to a list of arguments then the languages that
$get_const_language$ returns are considered as candidate languages for
the term.  The preferred languages are given by the second argument.
The first preferred language that is also a candidate will be
returned.  If no preferred language is a candidate matches then the
head element of the candidates will be returned.  Finally, the current
language (as given by $get_current_language$) is chosen if nothing else
is appropriate.

\section{TEST POLICY}

The pretty printer support functions are to be tested
according to the general criteria laid down in the quality
plan~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008}.  Two set of tests are considered.  Those
of the simple functional interfaces can readily be tested.  However,
much of the printer support functionality requires extensive
setting up of the calling environments (values of type $PpEnv$) and of
complex HOL terms.  Extensive tests of these latter form are included
in the module tests of the whole pretty printer(see its detailed design
in~\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD025}) which provides the necessary environment.
