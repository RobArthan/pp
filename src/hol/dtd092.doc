\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains the detailed design for further
theorems about sets for \ProductHOL.
The high level design for this material is given in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD011}.

\subsection{Introduction}
This document develops some more advanced theorems about sets, relations
and functions than those offered in the basic theories of
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD044,DS/FMU/IED/DTD071,DS/FMU/IED/DTD072}.
The theorems include the elements of the theory of transfinite cardinality
and results on which that theory is conveniently founded
such as Zorn's lemma and the well-ordering theorem.
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
The high-level design document, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD011}, describes the
theory structure which this document contributes to.

There are two practical motivations for supplying some basic facts about
transfinite cardinality.
Firstly, such facts would be required to
support a treatment of recursive type definitions along the lines
suggested in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/WRK016}, which, for instance, uses the
fact that if $a$ is an infinite set then $a$ has the same cardinality as
$a\times a$ (i.e., there exists a bijection between $a$ and $a\times a$).
Secondly, the proof contexts supplied with \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD071,DS/FMU/IED/DTD072}
have as yet received essentially no exposure to practical proof work on
problems of any size, and so proving the results described here was
intended to validate the practical value of these proof contexts.  
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This document depends on the theory design support
tools in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD035} and
on the theory of relations in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP071}
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
None known.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.

\section{ZORN'S LEMMA (SPECIAL CASE)}
\subsection{Introduction}
This section presents what is needed to state the difficult part of Zorn's
lemma as given in section 16 of the book ``Naive Set Theory''
by Paul R. Halmos, \cite{Halmos74}.
Recall that the informal statement of Zorn's
lemma is the following:

{\bf Theorem} If $a$ is a partially ordered set such that
every chain in $a$ has an upper bound, then $a$ contains a maximal element.

The difficult part of the proof as given in \cite{Halmos74} is the special case
when $a$ is a set of sets, the partial order is that of inclusion and
an upper bound of a chain may be
found by forming its union. The general
case reduces to this one fairly simply (by considering for each element
$x$ of $a$, the set comprising $x$ and all its predecessors). The intention
here is to prove this special case in the context of
the \ProductHOL\ theory of sets. It is then fairly straightforward to derive
the general case for the several different formulations of the idea of
a partial ordering relation with which it may be needed
(namely, for relations viewed as two-place propositional functions,
for relations viewed as sets of pairs, and, in \ProductZ\ for relations
viewed as sets of Z 2-tuples). The version for  relations as sets of
pairs is done in this document.

The main motivation for supplying Zorn's lemma in \Product\ is as
a step towards a treatment of recursive free types along the lines
of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/WRK016}. The theory developed there is based
upon standard results on infinite cardinalities and Zorn's lemma is a
convenient tool to have for developing that theory.

\subsection{Definitions}
We will put the theorem and the definitions on which it depends in a
child of the theory $sets$.
=SML
open_theory"sets";
new_theory"set_thms";
set_pc"sets_ext";
=TEX



We could conduct the proof without making any HOL definitions,
since the special notions Halmos uses are only required for the
proof itself, but the statement of the theorem is much clearer if
we do introduce constants to capture the notions involved.
It is feasible to avoid making constant definitions
for any notions other than these;
however, the polymorphic choice function which is used seems to be of
use elsewhere, and so, as it requires a manual consistency proof, it has been
defined as a constant here.

We adopt the following variable naming conventions, which differ from
those of \cite{Halmos74}: 
$x$, $y$, $z$ will be elements, $a$, $b$, $c$, sets, and $t$, $u$ and $v$,
sets of sets. E.g., Halmos's $\cal X$ will be $u$ throughout, 
his $A$ will be $a$.


To allow the term $chain$ to be used in other contexts
we choose to use the term {\em nest} for a chain of sets under inclusion.
As in the following HOL definition, this means that a {\em nest}
is any set of sets any two elements of which are comparable w.r.t the inclusion
relation.

πHOLCONST
	Nest : 'a SET SET ≠ BOOL
˜
	µu : 'a SET SET∑
	Nest u § µa b∑a ç u ± b ç u ¥ a Ä b ≤ b Ä a
∞

We say a set of sets is subset-closed if any subset of an element of the set
is also an element of the set:

πHOLCONST
	SubsetClosed : 'a SET SET ≠ BOOL
˜
	µu : 'a SET SET∑
	SubsetClosed u § µa b∑ a ç u ± b Ä a ¥ b ç u
∞

We say a set of sets is nest-closed if the union of any nest in the set
is an element of the set:

πHOLCONST
	NestClosed : 'a SET SET ≠ BOOL
˜
	µu : 'a SET SET∑
	NestClosed u § µv∑v Ä u ± Nest v ¥ ﬁv ç u
∞

The final notion required in the statement of the theorem is that
of a maximal element of a set of sets.
πHOLCONST
	MaximalâÄ : 'a SET SET ≠ 'a SET ≠ BOOL
˜
	µu : 'a SET SET; a : 'a SET∑
	MaximalâÄ u a § a ç u ± µb∑b ç u ± a Ä b ¥ b = a
∞



We define the polymorphic choice function which is used in the proof
since this may well be of use elsewhere. (It is the provable
consistency of the following definition which is the ``interface'' between
the proof we give and HOL's formulation of the axiom of choice (which
stems, essentially, from $\epsilon\_axiom$ and the other rules of simple
type theory)). 

πHOLCONST
	Choose : 'a SET ≠ 'a
˜
	µa : 'a SET∑ ≥a = {} § Choose a ç a
∞

\subsection{Theorem Requirements}
Our formal statement of the special case of Zorn's lemma
will then be the following conjecture:

=DESCRIBE
The Schroeder-Bernstein theorem in two guises. The first is the
usual general statement. The second is the special case when
one of the two injections is $Id(b)$ for $b$ a subset of $a$.
The special case is easier to prove than the general
one and the general case is a fairly trivial consequence of it.
Since the hypotheses of the special case are quite likely to occur
in applications it seems useful to export it to the user.
