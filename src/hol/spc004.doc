\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document specifies some high level aspects of a
proof development system for HOL.
It is part of a suite of documents specifying HOL
an overview of which may be found in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC001}.

\subsection{Introduction}

In \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC003} the rules of inference
and definitional mechanisms which make up the HOL
deductive system are defined. In this document
we turn to specifying some high level aspects of
the HOL proof development system.
Many of the types and functions used to specify
the logic may already be viewed as specifying
corresponding parts of the implementation.
We now wish to specify a generic type giving
an abstract model of a HOL proof development system and to
characterise the critical properties of such a system. 


The designer of a proof development system
is interested in ensuring
that the theorems which the users compute are indeed
derivable from the axioms of the theory involved.
The LCF approach to this problem is to use
a programming language supporting the
abstract data type concept. Theorems are represented
as elements of an abstract
data type whose constructor functions consist
precisely of the rules of inference (suitably parameterised
so that they are partial functions rather than arbitrary
relations).

In this way, the type system of the programming
language helps to ensure that only valid theorems may be
derived. In section \ref{RULESOFINFERENCEREVISITED} we
define the action of the rules of inference on
our type of theorems. These definitions can be viewed as a high level
specification of the constructor functions of the
abstract data type.
Such functions are used to
extend the set of theorems stored within a theory.


Finally, section \ref{THEORYHIERARCHIES} discusses
an abstraction of the database side of the proof development
system.
The concept of a named hierarchy of theories
is introduced and an abstraction of the state of
an HOL proof development system is presented.
Given this, we can define the generic type of an HOL
system and so define general predicates on such systems
expressing their critical properties.
In producing a very high assurance implementation
of HOL, this would give the starting point for some
meaningful proof work: one might attempt to prove 
that these properties held for a high level
design for a system defined in terms of
the theorem proving mechanisms of section
\ref{RULESOFINFERENCEREVISITED} and the (conservative)
definitional mechanisms of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC003}).

\section{PREAMBLE}
We introduce the new theory. Its parents are 
the theories $spc002$ and $spc003$ defined
in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC002} and \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC003}.

\section{THE RULES OF INFERENCE REVISITED} \label{RULESOFINFERENCEREVISITED}

In \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC001} the inference rules are
defined as relations between sequents.
We now wish to define
inference rules as relations between theorems, since this
gives a better model of what is done in a proof development
system.
Thus, recalling that a theorem is represented by a
pair $(S, T)$ where $T$ is a theory and $S$ is a sequent, we must specify how
the inference rules interact with the theory components.
Essentially, we say that
if, by rule {\bf X}{\it\_rule}, we may infer the sequent $S$
from $S_1, S_2, \ldots$, then, by {\bf X}, we
may infer $(S, T)$ from
$(S_1, T_1), (S_2, T_2), \ldots$ provided
the theory $T$ is an extension of each $T_i$.

Proof theoretically this is no different from
a rule which insists that $T_i = T$ for all $i$.
The more general formulation is meant to accord a 
little better with the thinking of the user of the
proof development system and may allow more freedom
in an implementation. An implementation need
not exploit the full generality.
For example, in the Cambridge HOL system
all proofs are conducted in the context
of a particular theory called the {\it current} theory.
Thus the abstract data type representing theorems
does not need a theory component and the current theory
is, effectively, an implicit and unused parameter to
the constructor functions of the abstract data type.
The ICL HOL system follows a different approach to
storage of theories and does tag theorems with the theory to
which they belong.

The definitions of the inference rules for theorems
are derived directly and tediously from the corresponding
rules for sequences. In each case, we simply change
the sequent arguments to theorem arguments, and check
that the corresponding rule for sequents holds for
the sequent components of the theorems and that the
theory component of the theorem inferred extends that
of all the other theorem arguments.

\section{THEORY HIERARCHIES AND THE HOL SYSTEM} \label{THEORYHIERARCHIES}

HOL systems operate not with the totality
of the type {\it THEORY}, but with subsets of it.
The subsets are structured as hierarchies in which
each theory has a name and a parenthood relation is
given on the names.
Moreover the representation of a theory provides
for the storage of theorems which have been proved.
Another important aspect is that the systems distinguish
between definitional extensions\footnote{%
Recall that in the terminology introduced in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC003}
``definitional'' extensions embrace the introduction of
new types isomorphic to subsets of old and loose specification
of new constants as well as simple definition by means of
an equation. %
} and axiomatic ones.
We will view a theory hierarchy
as a function from names to triples comprising
a theory, a set of sequents giving the definitional
axioms and a set of sequents giving the theorems which
have been saved.
We forget the parenthood
relation since we can recover its ancestral from the
extension relation on theories, and for our purposes
the ancestral is all that is needed.

Our abstraction for an HOL system is a (total) function\footnote{%
Arguably, a partial function or some similar,
more realistic abstraction should be used.},
which we think of as the state transition function for
an automaton whose state can be interpreted as a theory hierarchy.
We formulate three important properties of such functions: 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{4in}|}\hline
{\it(a)}&
a semantic property of the theorems in the system ---
do the transitions preserve truth?
I.e. given an input state in the interpretation of which every theorem
is true in every model of the corresponding theory,
does the result state have the same property? \\\hline
{\it(b)}&
a syntactic property of the theorems in the system ---
do the transitions preserve derivability?
I.e. given an input state in the interpretation of which every theorem is derivable
from the axioms of the corresponding theory, does the
output state have the same property? \\\hline
{\it(c)}&
a syntactic property of the theories in the
system --- are the definitional axioms in each theory
in the interpretation of the output state of a transition
the result of a definitional extension
of some theory in the interpretation of the input state? \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Neither {\it(a)} nor {\it(b)} prohibits arbitrary
axiomatic extensions, this is the purpose of {\it(c)}.
However {\it(c)} see says nothing about how the system
treats the theorems in a theory hierarchy.

The reason for stating the three properties separately
is to give a little latitude in the choice of a
critical property to verify for an implementation.
E.g. it would be appropriate to verify {\it(a)} and
{\it(c)} for a system which was asserted to
permit only the definitional extension mechanisms but
which contained built-in inference rules for which it
was felt that a semantic proof of correctness was
significantly easier than a syntactic one.

(It is possible to give semantic analogues of {\it(c)},
but I am not sure how useful they are.)

\subsection{Theory Hierarchies}

In our abstraction of a proof development system a theory
hierarchy is represented by the following type (we assume
that the finite function in an implementation is interpreted
as a total function by mapping unused names to some
well-known theory (e.g. $MIN$ or $INIT$):
=SML 
declare_type_abbrev(€"THEORY_HIERARCHY_REP"›, [],
			¨:STRING ≠ (THEORY ∏ (SEQ SET) ∏ (SEQ SET))Æ);
=TEX
The second components of the triples in the above definition
give the definitional axioms, the third components give
the theorems which have been saved in a theory.

The theory hierarchies in a proof development system
will be required to satisfy the following condition, which
says that for each theory the corresponding definitional
axioms are among its axioms and the corresponding stored
theorems are well-formed with respect to its type and
constant environment.
πHOLCONST
	€wf_hierarchy› : THEORY_HIERARCHY_REP SET
˜
	µhier∑

		µthyn∑	Fst(Snd(hier thyn)) Ä axioms (Fst(hier thyn))
		±	Snd(Snd(hier thyn)) Ä sequents (Fst(hier thyn))
∞
=TEX

The critical part of a proof development system states
will thus be interpreted as having the following type:
=SML 
type_spec {rep_fun="rep_theory_hierarchy", def_tm = ¨
	€THEORY_HIERARCHY› %simeq% €mk_theory_hierarchy› Of wf_hierarchy

=TEX
which we access with the following functions:
πHOLCONST

	th_theory hier thyn = Fst((rep_theory_hierarchy hier) thyn)

˜
	µ hier thyn seq ∑
		seq ç th_theorems hier thyn
	§	seq ç Snd(Snd((rep_theory_hierarchy hier) thyn))
∞
=TEX
\subsection{Proof Development Systems}
A HOL system may be interpreted as an
instance of the following polymorphic type, in which the first component stands
for the transition function for an automaton and the second for an
interpretation of the states of the automaton as theory hierarchies.
=SML 
declare_type_abbrev(€"HOL_SYSTEM"›, ["'INPUT", "'OUTPUT", "'STATE"], 
		¨:	(('INPUT ∏ 'STATE) ≠ ('STATE ∏ 'OUTPUT))
		 ∏	('STATE ≠ THEORY_HIERARCHY)Æ);
=TEX

The above definition does not capture any conditions
on the ``theorems'' stored in the theories in the
system other than their well-formedness as sequents.
We can now consider the properties of such systems which
we might wish to verify to give some confidence that
the ``theorems'' really are theorems of the logic.

\subsubsection{Property (a)}
This is the condition based on the semantics.
To describe it, let us say that
a hierarchy is $valid$ with respect to a type, $'U$,
if all of its ``theorems'' are satisfied in any model
of the theory with universe $'U$. We could then assert
that we are interested in systems which preserve
validity of hierarchies. Thus valid hierarchies for
the type $'U$ are given by:

πHOLCONST
	€valid_hierarchy› : 'U ≠ THEORY_HIERARCHY SET
˜
	µ (v:'U) hier∑
	hier ç valid_hierarchy v §
	µ(int:'U INTERPRETATION) thyn∑
		int ç is_model (th_theory hier thyn)
	¥	th_theorems hier thyn Ä {thm | int satisfies thm}
∞
=TEX

(Note that the apparently unused first parameter of
$valid\_hierarchy$ ensures that $'U$ appears in the
type of $valid\_hierarchy$, as required to satisfy the
restrictions on type variables imposed by
$new\_specification$.)

The validity preserving HOL systems for the type
$'U$ are given by:
πHOLCONST
	€validity_preserving› : 'U ≠ ('INPUT, 'OUTPUT, 'STATE)HOL_SYSTEM SET
˜
	µ (v:'U) tr_f int∑
	(tr_f, int) ç validity_preserving v §
	µinput st∑
	int st ç valid_hierarchy v ¥ int(Fst(tr_f(input, st))) ç valid_hierarchy v 
∞
=TEX

Thus the proposition for a given
system $sys$ would be the conjecture:
=GFT
	?Ù µ(v:'U)∑validity_preserving v sys
=TEX
I.e. property {\it(a)} is:
=GFT
	Ãsys:('INPUT, 'OUTPUT, 'STATE)HOL_SYSTEM∑µ(v:'U)∑validity_preserving v sys
=TEX


Note that it is inadequate just to prove an instance
of the above conjecture.
E.g. since there are no models of any
theory with universe a one-point type, the instance:
=GFT
	?Ù µ(v:one)∑validity_preserving v sys
=TEX
is trivially true for any $v$.
However, using a model of a (provably) consistent theory
such as $MIN$, it is possibly to construct systems
which are not validity preserving.

(This is an example of the need for the restrictions
imposed on type variables in the definition of
$new\_definition$ and
$new\_specification$ in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC002}.
The conjecture
=GFT
	?Ù xx = Ãsys:('INPUT, 'OUTPUT, 'STATE)HOL_SYSTEM∑µ(v:'U)∑
						validity_preserving v sys
=TEX
is equal to $Ãsys∑T$ at some instances of $'U$ but not at
others, and so cannot be the defining theorem of a
new constant $xx$).

\subsection{Property (b)}
This is the condition based on derivability.
We say that a hierarchy is $derivable$ if every theorem saved
in it is derivable from the axioms of the corresponding
theory.
(One may think of the hierarchy as being derived from
one with no saved theorems by a sequence of proof steps.)
πHOLCONST
	€derivable_hierarchy› : THEORY_HIERARCHY SET
˜
	µ hier∑
	hier ç derivable_hierarchy §
	µthyn seq∑ seq ç th_theorems hier thyn ¥ derivable_from seq (axioms(th_theory hier thyn))
∞
=TEX
Property {\it(b)} is then the condition on systems that
they preserve derivability of hierarchies:
πHOLCONST
	€derivability_preserving› : ('INPUT, 'OUTPUT, 'STATE)HOL_SYSTEM SET
˜
	µ tr_f int∑
	(tr_f, int) ç derivability_preserving §
	µinput st∑
	int st ç derivable_hierarchy ¥ int(Fst(tr_f(input, st))) ç derivable_hierarchy 
∞
=TEX
\subsection{Property (c)}
We will say that a HOL system is $standard$
if it only extends the definitional axioms in a theory
hierarchy by means of the definitional extension
mechanisms. Note that this does not prohibit axiomatic
extensions, it just ensures that the definitions components
in the theory hierarchy give a proper record of which
extensions are definitional and which are axiomatic.
We state this property as follows:
πHOLCONST
	€standard› : ('INPUT, 'OUTPUT, 'STATE)HOL_SYSTEM SET
˜
	µ tr_f int∑
	(tr_f, int) ç standard §
	µinput st new_thyn∑∂old_thyn thy tms∑
	let old_thy = th_theory (int st) old_thyn
	in let old_defs = th_definitions (int st) old_thyn
	in let new_thy = th_theory(int(Fst(tr_f(input, st))))new_thyn
	in let new_defs = th_definitions(int(Fst(tr_f(input, st))))new_thyn
	in
		old_thy ç definitional_extension thy
	±	new_axioms tms thy new_thy
	±	new_defs = old_defs ¿ (axioms thy \ axioms old_thy)
∞
=TEX

That is to say, the intermediate theory, $thy$, is a
definitional extension of $old\_thy$, $new\_thy$ is
obtained from $thy$ by adding axioms, and $new\_defs$
consists of $old\_defs$ together with the definitional
axioms introduced by the extension of $old\_thy$ to $thy$.
