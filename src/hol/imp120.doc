\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Scope}
This document gives the implementation of higher-order matching for HOL terms and
of proof procedures based on it.

\subsection{Purpose and Background}
See \cite{LEMMA1/HOL/DTD120}.

\subsection{Algorithms}
We follow Nipkow's
``Functional Unification of Higher-Order Patterns''
\cite{Nipkow93}.
As Nipkow says matching turns out to be significantly
easier than unification.

\section{THE STRUCTURE}
=TEX
=SML
structure ÛHigherOrderMatchingÝ : HigherOrderMatching = struct
=TEX
The narrative here refers mainly to the implementation
of unification given in figures 9 and 10 in Nipkow's paper.
Equivalents of the functional programming utilities of his figure 7
and the term manipulation functions of his figure 8
are provided with {\Product}.
=TEX
Nipkow's {\tt foldl} is our {\tt revfold} and
his {\tt foldr} is our {\tt fold}.

Nipkow distinguishes between free variables and loose bound variables in his syntax, the free variables being the variables that are subject to substitution, while the loose bound variables are treated as constants.
We work in an environment containing the current substitution and the list of loose bound variables.
Here and throughout we follow the {\Product}
convention of putting things relating to the target of the match to the left of things relating to the pattern:
so we represent a substition $[t_1/F_1, \ldots, t_k/F_k]$
using the pairs $(t_i, F_i)$ not $(F_i, t_i)$ as Nipkow does.
We carry around the type instantiation $\sigma$ and
term substitution $\theta$ (which becomes {\tt S}
in Nipkow's final code).
Each free variable appearing on the right-hand
side of a pair $(t_i, F_i)$ in $\theta$ has already been
instantiated to its final target type when it is
put in $\theta$ and no further instantation can apply to it.
The bound variables never need instantiation.
=SML
type ÛHOM_ENVÝ = {
	theta : (TERM * TERM) list,
	sigma : (TYPE * TYPE) list,
	bvars : TERM list
};
=TEX
=SML
fun Ûenv_assocÝ ({theta, ...} : HOM_ENV) (f : TERM) : TERM OPT = (
	rassoc5 theta f
);
=TEX
=SML
fun ÛredÝ (s : TERM) ([] : TERM list) : TERM = s
|   red (t : TERM) (yys as (y :: ys)) = (
	let	val (x, s) = dest_simple_Ì t;
	in	red (subst [(y, x)] s) ys
	end	handle Fail _ => list_mk_app (t, yys)
);
=TEX
In the following we do not need to test whether $t$ is a free variable: if it is in the domain of $\sigma$ it must be a free variable.
=SML
fun ÛdevarÝ (env : HOM_ENV) (t : TERM) = (
	let	val (f, ys) = strip_app t;
	in	case env_assoc env f of
			Value t => devar env (red t ys)
		|	Nil => t
	end
);
=TEX
We use the following local exception in place of Nipkow's {\tt Unif}.
=SML
exception HOMatch;
=TEX
We implement a preprocessing phase that $\eta$-normalises
the constituents of a function application $f\,y_1\,\ldots y_n$ in the pattern.
Nipkow mentions an $\eta$-normalisation phase on the $y_m$ as a possibility, and there seems to be no reason not do $f$ as well, thereby making our notion of
a linear pattern closed under $\eta$-conversion.
=SML
fun È_norm_fun_arg tm = (
	case dest_simple_term tm of
		SimpleÌ(x, b) => (
			let	val (g, y) = dest_app b;
			in	if	x = y
				then	È_norm_fun_arg g
				else	tm
			end	handle Fail _ => tm
		) |	_ => tm
);
=TEX
To keep the pattern to the right of the target, we do {\tt rigidflex} rather than {\tt flexrigid}.
=SML
fun ÛrigidflexÝ ({theta, sigma, bvars} : HOM_ENV)
	(t : TERM) (f : TERM, ym : TERM list) : HOM_ENV = (
	let	fun ok v = v mem ym orelse not(v mem bvars);
	in	case frees t drop ok of
			[] => (
				let	val ym' = map È_norm_fun_arg ym;
					val s = list_mk_Ì(ym', t);
					val theta' = (s, f)::theta;
				in	{theta = theta',
					 sigma = sigma,
					 bvars = bvars}
				end
		) |	_ =>	raise HOMatch
	end
);
=TEX
{\tt matchtypes} is used in the rigid-rigid case to
maintain the invariant that the two terms have the
same type. Note the type-matching here is necessary
even if $a$ and $b$ are Á-equivalent since we must not further instantiate
the type variables in the type of $a$.
The code drops redundant entries from $\sigma'$ here
to avoid the type instantiations doing unnecessary copying.
=SML
fun ÛmatchtypesÝ ({theta, sigma, bvars} : HOM_ENV)
	(a : TERM, ss : TERM list)
	(b : TERM, ts : TERM list) : HOM_ENV * TERM list = (
	let	val ty_a = type_of a;
		val ty_b = type_of b;
		val sigma'= type_match1 sigma ty_a ty_b;
		val env' = {
			theta = theta,
			sigma = sigma',
			bvars = bvars};
	in	if	a ~=$ b
		then	(env', ts)
		else if	fst(dest_const a) = fst(dest_const b)
		then	let	val i = inst [] (sigma' drop (op =));
				val ts' = map i ts;
			in	(env', ts')
			end
		else	raise HOMatch
	end	handle Fail _ => raise HOMatch	
);
=TEX
=SML
fun ÛpushbvarÝ ({theta, sigma, bvars} : HOM_ENV)
	(x : TERM) : HOM_ENV = (
	{theta = theta,
	 sigma = sigma,
	 bvars = x :: bvars}
);
=TEX
=SML
fun ÛpopbvarÝ ({theta, sigma, bvars} : HOM_ENV) : HOM_ENV = (
	{theta = theta,
	 sigma = sigma,
	 bvars = tl bvars}
);
=TEX
{\tt hom} is Nipkow's {\tt unif} simplified to do matching rather than unification.
It assumes caller has ensured that $s$ and $t$ have the same type and has recorded the type instantiation
used to do this in $\theta$.

=SML
fun ÛhomÝ ((s : TERM, t : TERM), env : HOM_ENV) : HOM_ENV = (
	let	val t1 = devar env t;
	in	case (dest_simple_term s, dest_simple_term t1) of
			(SimpleÌ(x, bs), SimpleÌ(y, bt)) => (
				let	val bt1 =
					if	x = y
					then	bt
					else	subst [(x, y)] bt;
					val env1 = pushbvar env x;
					val env2 = hom ((bs, bt1), env1);
				in	popbvar env2
				end
		) |	(SimpleÌ(x, bs), _) => (
				let	val t_x = mk_app(t1, x);
					val env1 = pushbvar env x;
					val env2 = hom ((bs, t_x), env1);
				in	popbvar env2
				end
		) |	(_, SimpleÌ(y, bt)) => (
				let	val s_y = mk_app(s, y);
					val env1 = pushbvar env y;
					val env2 = hom((s_y, bt), env1);
				in	popbvar env2
				end
		) |	_ => cases ((s, t1), env)
	end

To avoid problems with type variables being captured, we preprocess
the pattern to make its type variables distinct from the type variables
of the target term.
