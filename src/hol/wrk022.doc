\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document reports on a brief investigation into embedding the
possible worlds semantics for modal logic in HOL. 
\subsection{Introduction}
Modal propositional calculus is the ordinary propositional calculus
augmented by an additional connective $ÿ$. If $A$ is a proposition
the $ÿA$, the {\em necessitation} of $A$, was originally intended
to connote the idea that $A$ was, in some sense, a necessary rather
than a contingent fact. The semantics for this calculus due to
Kripke, explicates this notion of necessity in terms of a system,
called a {\em frame} in the literature,
comprising a set of
{\em possible worlds} supplied with a relation of {\em accessibility}
between worlds. A proposition is viewed as necessary in a world
if its truth in a world, $x$, implies its truth in every world
accessible from $x$.

It turns out that by placing various requirements on the accessibility
relation, we arrive at semantics which interpret the
necessitation operator in interesting and useful ways, for example:

\begin{itemize}
\item
transitive accessibility relations for which only a finite number
of worlds are accessible from any world correspond to
a view of $ÿ$ which is closely related to the provability
predicate for Peano arithmetic which leads to a useful framework
for understanding provability, consistency and self-reference
in the theory of arithmetic (see \cite{Boolos79}).
\item
Various forms of linear accessibility correspond to a view of $ÿ$
as a temporal operator, with $ÿA$ meaning that $A$ will always hold
if it holds now (see, e.g., \cite{Benthem88}).
\item
Taking the worlds as the states of a computer and taking ``$x$ is accessible
from $y$'' to mean ``$x$ results when we execute program $p$ in state $y$'',
we get a modal logic which is closely connected with weakest-precondition
semantics for programming languages (see \cite{Benthem88})
\item
Taking the worlds as the possible states of knowledge of some individual and taking
the accessibility to represent possible ways in which these states
grow through the acquisition of new knowledge, we get various forms
of {\em epistemic modal logic} in which $ÿA$ means that $A$ is known.
Such logics have a many applications in artificial intelligence and in
areas such as communication protocols in distributed computer systems
(see \cite{Ramsay88,burrows89}
\end{itemize}

In the sequel we are going to formalise the possible worlds semantics
in HOL and prove a semantic formulation of the two basic rules
of inference for modal logic.
We will also prove some theorems, due to Kripke (see, for example, \cite{Boolos79}), about
certain axioms used in various modal calculi.
To state the axioms we introduce the {\em possibility} operator, $\diamondsuit$.
$\diamondsuit A$ is defined as $å(ÿ(åA))$. 
In each case the theorem we prove, says that an axiom is valid provided
the accessibility relation possesses a certain property. The axioms
and properties are shown in the following table:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\hline
Axiom 1 & $ÿAäA$ & Reflexive \\\hline 
Axiom 2 & $ÿAäÿ(ÿA)$ & Transitive \\\hline 
Axiom 3 & $Aäÿ(˜A)$ & Symmetric \\\hline 
Axiom 4 & $˜Aäÿ(˜A)$ & Euclidean \\\hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

(The notion of a euclidean relation is defined in section \ref{AUXILIARYDEFINITIONS}
below.)
\subsection{Notation}
The present document is a
{\em literate script} containing a mixture of narrative
text and input for the ICL HOL system, which
is a tool for developing specifications and proofs in
the mathematical notation HOL.

The inputs for HOL consists of a sequence of commands in an extension
of the interactive programming language Standard ML.
The appendix contains a listing of the HOL theory set up by the script.


HOL constants are intoduced using constant definition
boxes which have the form:
 »
	c : ty,
…
	P
À
The intention of this is to introduce a new constants, $c$, 
of type $ty$, satisfying the property $P$. In the present document
$P$ will usually be a simple equation definition of a value or a function.

\subsection{HOL Preamble}

we will save our definitions and theorems.

\section{AUXILIARY DEFINITIONS}\label{AUXILIARYDEFINITIONS}
We need definitions of the concepts of $reflexive$, $transitive$,
$symmetric$ and $euclidean$ relations in HOL.

HOL is a polymorphic variant
of Church's type theory. Properties of values of type $\tau$ are
represented as propositional functions, that is to say they are
objects of type $\tau ã BOOL$, where $BOOL$ is the two-point type
of truth values. A binary relation on a type $\tau$
is a two-argument propositional function, i.e., it has type
$\tauã\tauãBOOL$.

Polymorphism allows us to use variables
which range over types, such type variables are distinguished syntactically
by having names beginning with the character $'$.
The propositional functions $Reflexive$, $Transitive$, etc. which
we will shortly define are polymorphic constants, they may be applied
to any object whose type has the form $\tauã\tauãBOOL$.

The definitions of the four properties of relations we need follow:

»
	Reflexive: ('a ã 'a ã BOOL) ã BOOL
…
	Érelé Reflexive rel Ç Éxé rel x x
À
\myindex{Reflexive}
»
	Transitive: ('a ã 'a ã BOOL) ã BOOL
…
	Érelé Transitive rel Ç Éx y zé rel x y Ä rel y z ä rel x z
À
\myindex{Transitive}
»
	Symmetric: ('a ã 'a ã BOOL) ã BOOL
…
	Érelé Symmetric rel Ç Éx yé rel x y ä rel y x
À
\myindex{Symmetric}
»
	Euclidean: ('a ã 'a ã BOOL) ã BOOL
…
	Érelé Euclidean rel Ç Éx y zé rel x y Ä rel x z ä rel y z
À
\myindex{Euclidean}

\section{POSSIBLE WORLD SEMANTICS IN HOL}
\subsection{Frames}
In a set-theoretic treatment a frame consists of a non-empty set $W$, of
{\em possible worlds}, equipped with a binary relation, $R$, the
{\em accessibility} relation. We will use a type variable
$'W$ to represent the possible worlds, so that our general treatment
can be instantiated to a particular type of possible worlds.
We can thus capture the notion
of a frame using the following type abbreviation:
=SML
declare_type_abbrev (‚"FRAME"·, ["'W"], ª:'W ã 'W ã BOOLº);
=TEX
\myindex{FRAME}
The above declaration introduces a new type abbreviation $FRAME$ with a single
formal parameter $'W$; The effect of the declaration is that, for example,
the type expression  $ª{:}(Ü)FRAMEº$ will represent the type
$ª:Ü ã Ü ã BOOLº$ of binary
relations on the type $Ü$ of natural numbers. Thus a value
of type $ª{:}(Ü)FRAMEº$ can be viewed as a frame in which the possible
worlds are numbers.

We will use the variable $R$ for an accessibility relation,
and $x$, $y$ and $z$ for worlds. 
=TEX
\subsection{Valuations}
A {\em valuation} will be a function assigning a truth-value to every possible
world. In a syntactic treatment we would work with an {\em evaluator}
assigning valuations in this sense to the propositional variables. In our
approach we can use HOL variables of the appropriate type to represent
the semantics directly. We use the following type abbreviation for
valuations:
=SML
declare_type_abbrev (‚"VALUATION"·, ["'W"], ª:'W ãBOOLº);
=TEX
\myindex{VALUATION}
Thus, for example, a value of type $ª{:}(Ü)VALUATIONº$ is a propositional function on
the natural numbers.

We will use the variables $A$, $B$ and $C$ for valuations.
\subsection{Propositional Connectives}
It is straightforward to give the semantics of the ordinary
propositional connectives in their modal guise.
In each case the modal version of a connective
combines the valuations which are its operands to give a valuation
which asserts that for every world
the corresponding propositional connective holds
between the values taken by the operands in that world.
The definitions of these connectives are therefore independent of
any accessibility relation.

We will take conjunction and implication as our primitive connectives
and define others in terms of them:

»
	‚Ò_modal·: ('W)VALUATION ã ('W)VALUATION ã ('W)VALUATION
…
	ÉA B xé Ò_modal A B x Ç A x ä B x
À
\myindex{Ò\_modal}
 
»
	‚å_modal·: ('W)VALUATION ã ('W)VALUATION
…
	ÉA xé å_modal A x Ç åA x
À
\myindex{å\_modal}
In making the above definitions, we had to distinguish the names for the modal
connectives from those already reserved for the propositional connectives
in HOL. The alias mechanism supported by ICL HOL allows us to use
the usual names instead as syntactic abbreviations. The following
declarations achieve this:
=SML
declare_alias(‚"Ò"·, ªÒ_modal: ('W)VALUATION ã ('W)VALUATION ã ('W)VALUATIONº);
declare_alias(‚"å"·, ªå_modal: ('W)VALUATION ã ('W)VALUATIONº);
=TEX
To see how this works, we can now use a more natural syntax for
the definition of modal disjunction and conjunction:

»
	‚Å_modal·: ('W)VALUATION ã ('W)VALUATION ã ('W)VALUATION
…
	ÉA Bé Å_modal A B = (åA Ò B)
À
\myindex{Å\_modal}
»
	‚Ä_modal·: ('W)VALUATION ã ('W)VALUATION ã ('W)VALUATION
…
	ÉA Bé Ä_modal A B = å(A Ò åB)
À
\myindex{Ä\_modal}
Note here that $å$ and $ä$ refer to the modal connectives. The HOL
$å$ and $ä$ may still be used --- the ICL HOL system
identifies the appropriate internal representation on the basis of the types
of the operands.

As with the other connectives we make alias declarations for the
modal disjunction and conjunction:
=SML
declare_alias("‚Å·", ªÅ_modal: ('W)VALUATION ã ('W)VALUATION ã ('W)VALUATIONº);
declare_alias("‚Ä·", ªÄ_modal: ('W)VALUATION ã ('W)VALUATION ã ('W)VALUATIONº);
=TEX


\subsection{Necessitation}
The necessitation operator, $ÿ$, is defined with respect to
a given frame $R$; The necessitation of a valuation, $A$, is the valuation
which is true at a world $W$ if and only if $A$ is true at every world
accessible from $W$. The HOL definition of this is as follows
»
	‚ÿ·: ('W)FRAME ã ('W)VALUATION ã ('W)VALUATION
…
	ÉR A xé ÿR A x Ç Éyé R x y ä A y
À
\myindex{ÿ}
\subsection{Possibility}
The possibility operator, $˜$, is defined in terms of
necessitation and negation as follows:
»
	‚˜·: ('W)FRAME ã ('W)VALUATION ã ('W)VALUATION
…
	ÉR Aé ˜R A = å(ÿR(åA))
À

\subsection{Validity}
A valuation is valid if it is true in every world. Thus:
»	
	‚Valid·: ('W)VALUATION ã BOOL
…
	ÉAé Valid A Ç Éxé A x
À
\myindex{Valid}
\subsection{A Rewrite System}

In the sequel, we will use the above definitions to prove some theorems
about the semantics. The proofs will have a common pattern, in which
the first step is to expand out the above definitions to reduce the goal
to be proved to a proposition in the predicate calculus. The following
ML command gives us an ML value containing the list of defining theorems
which we use to do this.
=SML
val ‚modal_rewrites· = map snd (get_defns"-");
=TEX
\myindex{modal\_rewrites}
This pattern of proof is common in most applications of HOL: at the beginning
of building a theory, one often has to reduce problems to first priniciples.
Usually, once one has established a basic repertoire of theorems
characterising the problem domain, subsequent
proofs are performed at a higer-level using the characterising theorems.

\subsection{INFERENCE RULES}
Using the definitions of the previous section we can now prove
some results about the the modal operators.
In this section we prove two theorems which are the semantic justifications
for the two inference rules usually associated with modal logics.


\subsection{Modus Ponens}
The rule of modus ponens for modal logic is given by the following
HOL theorem.
As an inference rule, modus ponens says that from $A$ and
$A\,ä\,B$ we may infer $B$. We see from the semantic formulation
we will now state and prove that this does not depend
on the accessibility relation:
=SML
push_goal([], ªÉA Bé Valid A Ä Valid (A Ò B) ä Valid Bº);
=TEX
The above command initiates a session with the ICL HOL subgoal package,
the standard means of finding proofs by a goal oriented search.
Goals are reduced to subgoals by applying tactics. A discussion of
how proofs are conducted is outside the scope of this document.
The proofs give here follow a common pattern. First we rewrite with
the definitions to reduce the goal to a predicate calculus proposition.
We then break this down using the standard tactic for simplifying
such propositions, $strip\_tac$.
This stripping gives us a simpler goal and some assumptions
on which to prove to. In the present proofs, one or more of the
assumptions turns out to be a universally quantified
formula, which we use to prove the goal by specialisation and rewriting.
=SML
a(rewrite_tac modal_rewrites);
a(REPEAT strip_tac);
a(POP_ASM_T (ante_tac o simple_É_elimªxº) THEN asm_rewrite_tac[]);
=TEX
=SML
val ‚modal_mp_thm· = save_thm("modal_mp_thm", pop_thm());
=TEX
\myindex{modal\_mp\_thm}
\subsection{Necessitation}
The rule of necessitation says that from $A$ we may infer$ÿA$.
Again this rule holds for any accessibility relation.
=SML
push_goal([], ªÉR:('W) FRAME; Aé Valid A ä Valid (ÿR A)º);
=TEX
=SML
a(rewrite_tac modal_rewrites);
a(REPEAT strip_tac THEN asm_rewrite_tac[]);
=TEX
=SML
val ‚necessitation_thm· = save_thm("necessitation_thm", pop_thm());
=TEX
\myindex{necessitation\_thm}
\section{FOUR AXIOMS}
In this section we prove the promised four results about the interplay
between common modal axioms and standard properties of the accessibility
relation. 
\subsection{Axiom 1}
This axiom holds for reflexive accessibility relations:
=SML
push_goal([], ªÉRé Reflexive R ä ÉAé Valid(ÿR A Ò A)º);
=TEX
=SML
a(rewrite_tac modal_rewrites);
a(REPEAT strip_tac);
a(POP_ASM_T (ante_tac o simple_É_elimªxº) THEN asm_rewrite_tac[]);
=TEX
=SML
val ‚axiom1_thm· = save_thm("axiom1_thm", pop_thm());
=TEX
\myindex{axiom1\_thm}
\subsection{Axiom 2}
This axiom holds for transitive accessibility relations:
=SML
push_goal([], ªÉRé Transitive R ä ÉAé Valid(ÿR A Ò ÿR (ÿR A))º);
=TEX
=SML
a(rewrite_tac modal_rewrites);
a(REPEAT strip_tac);
a(DROP_NTH_ASM_T 4 (ante_tac o list_simple_É_elim[ªxº, ªyº, ªy'º]) THEN asm_rewrite_tac[]);
=TEX
=SML
val ‚axiom2_thm· = save_thm("axiom2_thm", pop_thm());
=TEX
\myindex{axiom2\_thm}
\subsection{Axiom 3}
This axiom holds for symmetric accessibility relations:
=SML
push_goal([], ªÉRé Symmetric R ä ÉAé Valid(A Ò ÿR (˜R A))º);
=TEX
=SML
a(rewrite_tac modal_rewrites);
a(REPEAT strip_tac);
a(DROP_NTH_ASM_T 3 (ante_tac o list_simple_É_elim[ªxº, ªyº]) THEN asm_rewrite_tac[]);
a(REPEAT strip_tac THEN simple_Ñ_tacªxº THEN asm_rewrite_tac[]);
=TEX
=SML
val ‚axiom3_thm· = save_thm("axiom3_thm", pop_thm());
=TEX
\myindex{axiom3\_thm}
\subsection{Axiom 4}
This axiom holds for euclidean accessibility relations:
=SML
push_goal([], ªÉRé Euclidean R ä ÉAé Valid(˜R A Ò ÿR (˜R A))º);
=TEX
=SML
a(rewrite_tac modal_rewrites);
a(REPEAT strip_tac);
a(DROP_NTH_ASM_T 4 (ante_tac o list_simple_É_elim[ªxº, ªy'º, ªyº]) THEN asm_rewrite_tac[]);
a(REPEAT strip_tac THEN simple_Ñ_tacªyº THEN asm_rewrite_tac[]);
=TEX
=SML
