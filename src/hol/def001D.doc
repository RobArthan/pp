To be included as the section `ALIASES, OVERLOADING'
=TEX
The HOL system allows alternative names, called {\em aliases}, to be declared
for particular instances of constants.  This facility allows different
names (and associated fixities and precedences) to be used for the same
function. For example, it is natural to make the symbol `¤' an alias
for the boolean instance of the polymorphic equality operator, `$=$', and
to give `¤' a lower precedence than `$=$', so that a term such as
=INLINEFT
¬x = y ¤ a = b®
=TEX
\ associates as
=INLINEFT
¬(x = y) ¤ (a = b)®
=TEX
\ .

Different constants may have a common alias. This allows aliases
to be used to achieve the effect of overloaded constant names.
For example, it would be natural to use `$+$' as an alias for
the additions on natural number, integers, rational etc.

An alias may be the same as a constant name. This allows an application in
which the terminology conflicts with that used in a library theory
to be handled in its own terms. For example, if \verb"sin" denotes the sine
function in a library theory, the name \verb"sin" might be made an alias
of \verb"transgression" in a theory of ethics.

The precise syntax of an alias declaration is implementation-dependent
as are the rules which govern overload resolution.
