\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design of the types and terms of ICL HOL, and functions to handle them, called for by the first point of section 4.2 of the Release 1 ICL HOL Product Requirement Specification \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF004},
and the high level design \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD007}.
The high-level specification for the code may be considered
to be given in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC001}.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP003}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design of the types and terms of ICL HOL, and functions to handle them.
There will be sufficient functions provided to define the type $THM$.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
The code in this document depends upon the material in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP001}.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}

\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}

\subsubsection{Terminology}
In may be necessary when using the following terminology to remove ambiguity by prefixing some of the following with the word ``term'' or ``HOL'', to constrast with 
Standard ML terminology, or, for instance, theorems
whose conclusions are describable in the same terms.

\begin{tabular}{p{1.3in} p{4.9in}}
type variable & A HOL type formed by $mk\_vartype$. \\
compound type & A HOL type formed by $mk\_ctype$: a type constructor applied to sufficent types. \\
function type & A HOL type formed by $mk\_‹\_type$: the
type of HOL functions. \\
constant & A term formed by $mk\_const$. \\
variable & A term formed by $mk\_var$. \\
application & A term of the form $»f\ t¼$, as constructed by $mk\_app$
: the application of a function to an argument. \\
binder & A term constant which has, in the current context, the
 status of ``binder'' (see, e.g., $declare\_binder$). The class includes $»\$ƒ¼$ and $»\$„¼$.\\
$$-abstraction & A term of the form $»\ x\ Ž\ f[x]¼$,
as constructed by $simple\_mk\_$ or $mk\_$,
or of the form $»\ (x,y)\ Ž\ f[x,y]¼$, as constructed by $mk\_$. \\
simple abstraction & A term of the form $»B\ x\ Ž\ f[x]¼$
where $B$ is a binder or $$, and $x$ a simple variable. \\
paired abstraction & Either a simple abstraction, or
a term of the form $»B\ (x,y)\ Ž\ f[x,y]¼$
where $B$ is a binder or $$, and $(x,y)$ any variable structure allowed by the concrete syntax. \\
abstraction & A paired abstraction, used where the word ``paired'' may be dropped without ambiguity. \\
equation & A term of the form $»x\ =\ y¼$ or $»x\ ‚\ y¼$,
as constructed by $mk\_eq$. The class includes bi-implications. \\
implication & A term of the form $»x\ Š\ y¼$, as constructed by $mk\_Š$. \\
$ƒ$-term & A universally quantified term of the form $»ƒ\ x\ Ž\ P[x]¼$, as constructed by $simple\_mk\_ƒ$ or $mk\_ƒ$,
or a term of the form $»ƒ\ (x,y)\ Ž\ P[x,y]¼$, as constructed by $mk\_ƒ$. \\
$„$-term & An existentially quantified term of the form $»„\ x\ Ž\ P[x]¼$, as constructed by $simple\_mk\_„$ or $mk\_„$,
or a term of the form $»„\ (x,y)\ Ž\ P[x,y]¼$, as constructed by $mk\_„$. \\
numeric literal & A constant of the form $»0¼$, $»1¼$,..., as constructed by $mk\_†$. \\
character literal & A constant of the form  $»`a`¼$, $»`b`¼$,..., as constructed by $mk\_char$. \\
string literal & A constant of the form $»""¼$, $»"a"¼$, $»"ab"¼$,..., as constructed by $mk\_string$. \\

=DESCRIBE
Given a destroyed term variable, checks to see if it is free within the term supplied as a second argument.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Generic Derived Term Structure Functions}
The following functions are provided to give a standard, generic, approach
to implementing various derived term manipulation functions.
For instance, the functions of section \ref{SpecificFunctions} will usually
be implemented by just a call to one of these functions.

A performance issue arises with the destructor functions for
derived term constructors: need they test the types of constants?
We do not make this test, and thus might give the ``wrong''
results with ill-formed terms.
It is not necessary to worry about this if we are only concerned about
saved theorems, etc, as these are checked for well-formedness of their constituents.
In addition, the constants required to implement the abstract data type $THM$ cannot occur with incorrect types, by
the mechanism of $mk\_const$.
Apart from this, some misleading results on handling terms could occur,
but no inconsistency arises.

\subsection{Generic Binary Operators}
=DOC
val âmk_bin_opá : string -> int -> int -> (TYPE -> TYPE -> TERM) ->
	(TERM * TERM) -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
$mk\_bin\_op$ $area$ $msg1 $msg2$ $rator\_fn$ $(t_1, t_2)$ attempts to form the term $»t_1\ rator\ t_2¼$.
$rator'$ is gained by applying $rator\_fn$ to the types of $t_1$ and $t_2$.
=FAILUREC
\paragraph{Failure}
The failure message for failing to apply $rator$ to 
the first term will be from area $area$, and will have the text indexed by $msg1$, with the two terms as strings for arguments.
If the failure is from applying the rators plus first term to the second term will be from area $area$, and will have the text indexed by $msg2$, with the two terms as strings for arguments.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val âdest_bin_opá : string -> int -> string -> TERM -> (TERM * TERM);

If the function fails it will fail with message $msg$, area $area$ and with the string form of $term$.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val âis_bin_opá : string -> TERM -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
$is\_bin\_op$ $rator\_nm$ $term$ is true iff. $term$ is of the form »rator\ t1\ t2¼, and $rator$ is
a constant with name $rator\_nm$.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val âlist_mk_bin_opá : string -> int -> int ->
	(TYPE -> TYPE -> TERM) -> TERM list -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
This function combines a list of terms using the given operator, as if by $mk\_bin\_op$ (q.v).
Notice the bracketing in the example.
=EXAMPLE
list_mk_bin_op area msg €_fun [»a¼, »b € c¼, »d¼] = 
		»a € ((b € c) € d)¼ 
=TEX
where $€\_fun$ takes two (dummy) arguments and returns »\$€¼.
=FAILURE
3017	An empty list argument is not allowed
=FAILUREC
\paragraph{Failure}
The failure message for failing to combine its arguments will be as $mk\_bin\_op$ for the offending two arguments.
If given an empty list the error will be from area $area$, but with message 3017.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val âstrip_bin_opá : string -> TERM -> TERM list
=DESCRIBE
This function strips a binary operator, attempting to destroy its term argument, and recursively stripping to the right,
as if by $dest\_bin\_op$.
A term not formed from the operator is returned unchanged,
as a singleton list.
=EXAMPLE
strip_bin_op "€" »a € (b € c) € d¼ = [»a¼, »b € c¼, »d¼]
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val âbin_bool_opá : string -> TYPE -> TYPE -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
Returns a constant with the given name, and type 
\[»:BOOL\ ‹\ BOOL\ ‹\ BOOL¼\]
The type arguments are dummies, present only to make the function
have an acceptable signature for certain other functions.

=DOC
val âmk_mon_opá : string -> int -> (TYPE -> TERM) ->
	TERM -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
$mk\_mon\_op$ $area$ $msg$ $rator\_fn$ $rand$ attempts to form the term $»rator\ rand¼$.
The $rator$ is gained by applying $rator\_fn$ to the type of $rand$.

The failure message for failing to apply $rator$ to its arguments will be from area $area$, and will have the text indexed by $msg$.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val âdest_mon_opá : string -> int -> string -> TERM -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
$dest\_mon\_op$ $area$ $msg$ $rator\_nm$ $term$ assumes that $term$ is of the form $»rator\ t¼$, where 
$rator$ is a constant with name $rator\_nm$, and the function attempts to return $t$.

$simple\_mk\_binder$ $area$ $msg$ $binder\_fn$ $(var,\ body)$ generates the term:
\[»binder( var\ Ž\ body)¼\] where $binder$ is $binder\_fn$ applied to the types of $var$ and $body$.
$var$ must be a term variable.
=SEEALSO
$mk\_binder$
=FAILURE
3007	?0 is not a term variable
=FAILUREC
\paragraph{Failure}
If the term cannot be made, then the error will be from $area$, with a message indexed by $msg$, and the two terms as string arguments.
If the first of the pair of terms is not a variable then
error 3007 will be given from area $area$.
=ENDDOC
=DOC

\subsection{Literals}
There are three types of literal: numbers, strings and characters.
\subsubsection{Numeric Literals}

The representation of numeric literals is by HOL constants whose type
is~``†'' and where the string component of the constant is entirely
decimal digits, the digits being the decimal representation of the
literal.

=DOC
val â†á : TYPE;
=DESCRIBE

=FAILURE
3026	?0 is not a numeric literal
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val âis_†á : TERM -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
Is the term a numeric literal?
=ENDDOC
\subsubsection{Character Literals}

Character literals are represented by HOL constants of type ``$CHAR$''
where the string component of the constant is exactly two characters
long, the first being the back-quotation~(~`~) and the second the
character itself.  The back-quotation~(~`~) is chosen as it is used in
the concrete syntax representation of character literals.

The construction and destruction functions have as argument and result
(respectively) a string holding a single character.  The back-quotation
is intended for use only in the internal representation of character
literals.  However, the internal representation will be returned by, e.g., a
call of $(simple\_)dest\_term$.

=DOC
val âCHARá : TYPE;
=DESCRIBE
This is the type of single characters.
óDefinition
val CHAR = »:CHAR¼;

=FAILURE
3024	?0 is not a character literal
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val âis_chará : TERM  -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
Is the term a character literal?
=ENDDOC

\subsubsection{String Literals}

String literals are represented by HOL constants of type ``$STRING$''
where the first character of string component of the constant is the
double-quote~(~{\tt"}~) and the remainder is the body of the string.
The double-quote~(~{\tt"}~) is chosen as it is used in the concrete
syntax representation of strings.

The construction and destruction functions have as argument and result
(respectively) the body of the string.  The double-quote is intended
for use only in the internal representation of strings.  However, the
internal representation will be returned by a call of,
e.g.
$(simple\_)dest\_term$.

=DOC
val âSTRINGá : TYPE;
=DESCRIBE
This is the HOL type of strings, a type abbreviation for lists
of objects of type $CHAR$.

\section{TEST POLICY}
In \cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008} there is a statement of the general principle of testing to be adopted.
This section gives some individual comments on special testing requirements for individual functions.

A key problem in the functions provided is to ensure that
free variable capture does not occur.
That is, due to some change, a variable that was free, becomes unintentionally bound.
