\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design of the types and terms of ICL HOL, and utilities to handle them, called for by the first point of section 4.2 of the Release 1 ICL HOL Product Requirement Specification \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF004}.
The high-level specification for the code may be considered
to be given in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC001}.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP003}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design of the types and terms of ICL HOL, and utilities to handle them.
These will be sufficient functions upon $TERM$ to define the type $THM$.

\section{TYPES AND TERMS}
=DOC
signature ‚icl'TypesAndTerms· = sig
=DESCRIBE
This provides the type of ICL HOL types: $TYPE$, of ICL HOL terms: $TERM$, and some
utility functions upon them.
A user should access all the elements of this signature through signature $DerivedTerms$ in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD004}.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{The Type: $TYPE$}
It may well be worth considering making the function type constructor
a constructor of the datatype $TYPE$. The advantage would be that
function types could then be recognised by a simpler pattern match (not
involving a string equality test).
We have not done this since it complicates some issues.

By using the names $mk\_vartype$ and $mk\_type$ below we follow the convention for naming construction and destruction functions,
rather than data constructors.
=DOC
datatype ‚TYPE· =
		‚mk_vartype· of string |
		‚mk_type·    of string * TYPE list;
=DESCRIBE
All ICL HOL terms will be ``typed'', by associating them with
an object of type $TYPE$.
A type may either be a variable (or generic) type, indicated in the
concrete syntax by $:'<name>$;
or a type constructor, with a list of type arguments, indicated by
$typename$, $arg\ typename$ or $(arg_1, \ldots, arg_n)\ typename$,
for types with none, one or many arguments.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Functions Upon the Type $TYPE$}
=DOC
val ‚dest_type· : TYPE -> string * TYPE list;
=DESCRIBE
Extract the arguments to $mk\_type$ by function rather than pattern-matching.
=FAILURE
3001	Argument is not of form: mk_type(<string>,<type list>)
	but mk_vartype ?0
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val ‚mk_fun· : (TYPE * TYPE) -> TYPE;
=DESCRIBE
$mk\_fun$ $(ty_1,\ ty_2)$ is $":ty_1 ã ty_2"$.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val ‚icl'inst_type· : ((TYPE * string) list) -> TYPE -> TYPE;
=DESCRIBE
$inst\_type$ $alist$ $type$ recursively descends through $type$, replacing any type variables by whatever the association list $alist$ associates with them.
If the association list does not contain a type variable found in $type$, then that type variable will not be changed.
Replaced types are {\bf not} recursively processed by this function.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val ‚type_tycons· : TYPE -> (string * int) list;
=DESCRIBE
This returns a list of names of type constructors, and the arity of their use, within a type.

=ENDDOC
=TEX
\subsection{The Types $TERM$ and $DEST\_TERM$}
=DOC
type ‚TERM·;
=DESCRIBE
This is the type of well-formed ICL HOL terms.
Objects of this type are manipulated by term constructor and destructor functions, such as $mk\_comb$, $dest\_abs$ and $is\_var$.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
datatype ‚DEST_TERM· = ‚Var· of string * TYPE |
	‚Const· of string * TYPE |
	‚Comb· of TERM * TERM |
	‚Abs· of TERM * TERM;
=DESCRIBE
This is the type of destroyed terms, related to the type $TERM$ by
$dest\_TERM$ and $mk\_TERM$.
The four data constructors represented destroyed variables, constants, combinations and abstractions respectively.
=USES
In writing pattern-matching functions upon ICL HOL terms.

\subsection{Derived Term Structure Functions}
\subsubsection{Generic Derived Term Structure Functions}
A performance issue arises with the destructor functions for
derived term constructors: need they test the types of constants?
We do not make this test. It is not necessary if the
definition of two constants with the same name is
disallowed.

val ‚list_variant· : TERM list -> TERM list -> TERM list;
=DESCRIBE
$list\_variant$ $stoplist$ $vlist$ returns a list of variants that are not present in the $stoplist$, nor contain any duplicates, one for each member of $vlist$.
The variants are generated by sufficient priming.
=FAILUREC
\paragraph{Failure}
The function may give rise to errors from $variant$.

val ‚is_free_in· : TERM -> TERM -> bool;

$is\_free\_in$ $v$ $term$ is true iff. $v$ is a free variable in
$term$.

val ‚var_subst· : (TERM * TERM) list -> TERM -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
$var\_subst$ $alist$ $term$ returns the term formed by, for each pair in $alist$, substituting in $term$ all instances of the term variable which is the second of the pair with the first of the pair.

Note that the term variables must have the same types as the term that is to replace them.
=FAILURE
3060	The second of each pair in the substitution list must be a term variable

val ‚TERM_map· : ((TERM list) -> TERM -> TERM) -> TERM -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
$TERM\_map$ $tmfun$ $tm$ traverses
$tm$ (breadth first) looking for subterms for which
the application $tmfun\,tm$ does not fail and replaces
such subterms with $tmfun\,tm$. $tmfun$ has as its first argument a list giving
the bound variables which are in scope at the point of use.
It does not attempt to apply $tmfun$ to a bound variable of an abstraction.

=DOC
val ‚inst· : TERM list -> (TYPE * TYPE) list -> TERM -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
$inst$ $alist$ $slist$ $term$ instantiates the type variables of $term$ with the associated types found in $slist$.
An element of $slist$ will be ($return$, $tv$),
where $tv$ is a type variable that is to be instantiated to $return$.
It will rename bound variables as necessary to prevent name capture problems.
It will also not allow variables to become the same as those in the avoidance list, $alist$.
=FAILURE
3061	First argument must be a list of term variables
3062	Second argument must be a list of (TYPE * type variables)

\section{TEST POLICY}
In \cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008} there is a statement of the general principle of testing to be adopted.
This section gives some individual comments on special testing requirements for individual functions.

A key problem in the functions provided is to ensure that
free variable capture does not occur.
That is, due to some change, a variable that was free, becomes unintentionally bound.
