\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design of the types and terms of ICL HOL, and functions to handle them, called for by the first point of section 4.2 of the Release 1 ICL HOL Product Requirement Specification \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DEF004},
and the high level design \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD007}.
The high-level specification for the code may be considered
to be given in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/SPC001}.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP003}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design of the types and terms of ICL HOL, and functions to handle them.
There will be sufficient functions provided to define the type $THM$.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
The code in this document depends upon the material in
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP001}.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
None known.
\subsubsection{Terminology}
In may be necessary when using the following terminology to remove ambiguity by prefixing some of the following with the word ``term'' or ``HOL''. This will prevent confusions with
Standard ML terminology, or, for instance, theorems
whose conclusions are describable in the same terms.

\begin{tabular}{p{1.3in} p{4.9in}}
exception & By this we only mean an exception raised by Standard ML's $raise$, and functions derived from it:
we only touch on user interrupts, paging errors, etc,
when these are explicitly noted kinds of exceptions to be considered. \\
type variable & A HOL type formed by $mk\_vartype$. \\
compound type & A HOL type formed by $mk\_ctype$: a type constructor applied to sufficient types. \\
function type & A HOL type formed by $mk\_­\_type$: the
type of HOL functions. \\
constant & A term formed by $mk\_const$. \\
variable & A term formed by $mk\_var$. \\
application & A term of the form $¬f\ t®$, as constructed by $mk\_app$
: the application of a function to an argument. \\
binder & A constant which has, in the current context, the
 status of ``binder'' (see, e.g., $declare\_binder$). In most contexts the class includes $¬\$µ®$ and $¬\$¶®$.\\
$Ì$-abstraction & A term of the form $¬Ì\ x\ ·\ f[x]®$,
as constructed by $mk\_simple\_Ì$ or $mk\_Ì$,
or of the form $¬Ì\ (x,y)\ ·\ f[x,y]®$, as constructed by $mk\_Ì$. \\
simple abstraction & A term of the form $¬B\ x\ ·\ f[x]®$
where $B$ is a binder or $Ì$, and $x$ a simple variable. \\
paired abstraction & Either a simple abstraction, or
a term of the form $¬B\ (x,y)\ ·\ f[x,y]®$
where $B$ is a binder or $Ì$, and $(x,y)$ any variable structure allowed by the concrete syntax. \\
abstraction & A paired abstraction, used where the word ``paired'' may be dropped without ambiguity. \\
equation & A term of the form $¬x\ =\ y®$ or $¬x\ ¤\ y®$,
as constructed by $mk\_eq$. The class includes bi-implications. \\
implication & A term of the form $¬x\ ´\ y®$, as constructed by $mk\_´$. \\
antecedent & the subterm to the left of the $´$ in an implication, e.g. $¬x®$ in $¬x\ ´\ y®$. \\
consequent & the subterm to the right of the $´$ in an implication, e.g. $¬y®$ in $¬x\ ´\ y®$. \\
$µ$-term & A universally quantified term of the form $¬µ\ x\ ·\ P[x]®$, as constructed by $mk\_simple\_µ$ or $mk\_µ$,
or a term of the form $¬µ\ (x,y)\ ·\ P[x,y]®$, as constructed by $mk\_µ$. \\
$¶$-term & An existentially quantified term of the form $¬¶\ x\ ·\ P[x]®$, as constructed by $mk\_simple\_¶$ or $mk\_¶$,
or a term of the form $¬¶\ (x,y)\ ·\ P[x,y]®$, as constructed by $mk\_¶$. \\
numeric literal & A constant from the list $¬0®$, $¬1®$,..., as constructed by $mk\_î$. \\
character literal & A constant from the list  $¬`a`®$, $¬`b`®$,..., as constructed by $mk\_char$. \\
string literal & A constant from the list $¬""®$, $¬"a"®$, $¬"b"®$, $¬"ab"®$,..., as constructed by $mk\_string$. \\

\section{TYPES AND TERMS}
=DOC
signature Ûpp'TypesAndTermsÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
This provides the type of HOL types: $TYPE$, of HOL terms: $TERM$, and some functions upon them.
A user should access all the elements of this signature through signature $DerivedTerms$ (q.v.).
=ENDDOC
The types and terms module is now stateful. It needs functions to allocate and restore its state
(which is a ref-ref to work properly under Poly/ML). These functions are stubbed once
the abstract data type of theorems has bound to them. The error message below is for use
when this is done.
=SML
type ÛTYPES_AND_TERMS_STATEÝ
val Ûnew_types_and_terms_stateÝ : unit -> TYPES_AND_TERMS_STATE;
val Ûset_types_and_terms_stateÝ : TYPES_AND_TERMS_STATE -> unit;
val Ûget_types_and_terms_stateÝ : unit -> E_KEY E_DICT;
=FAILURE
3029	this function is only available during system build
=TEX
The following error message indicates that a term has been encountered that the abstract data type for $TERM$ thought incapable of formation.
A number of functions make use of this message to indicate this ``impossible'' condition.
=FAILURE
3064	DESIGN ERROR : ill-formed term encountered
=TEX
\subsection{The Type: $TYPE$}
=DOC
eqtype ÛTYPEÝ;
=DESCRIBE
All HOL terms will be ``typed'', by associating them with
an object of type $TYPE$.
A type may either be a type variable or a compound type.

This is not an equality type (i.e. $=$ cannot be used in tests for equality - see $=:$ instead.).
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Û=:Ý : (TYPE * TYPE) -> bool
=DESCRIBE
This is the (infix) equality test for HOL types.
It is retained for backwards compatibility --- the type of HOL types is now an equality type.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Constructors and Destructors of the Type $TYPE$}
\subsubsection{Simple Destroyed Types}
=DOC
datatype ÛDEST_SIMPLE_TYPEÝ =
	ÛVartypeÝ of string
|	ÛCtypeÝ of (string * TYPE list);
=DESCRIBE
This is the type of simple destroyed types, related to the type $TYPE$ by
$dest\_simple\_type$(q.v.) and $mk\_simple\_type$(q.v.).
The value constructors correspond to type variables and compound types.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûdest_simple_typeÝ : TYPE -> DEST_SIMPLE_TYPE;
=DESCRIBE
This function destroys a HOL type into something of type $SIMPLE\-\_DEST\-\_TYPE$ (q.v.).
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûmk_simple_typeÝ : DEST_SIMPLE_TYPE -> TYPE;
=DESCRIBE
This function constructs a HOL type from something of type $SIMPLE\-\_DEST\-\_TYPE$ (q.v.).
=ENDDOC

\subsubsection{Compound Types}
=DOC
val Ûmk_ctypeÝ : string * TYPE list -> TYPE;
=DESCRIBE
Create a compound type from a type constructor and sufficient
arguments.
The function makes no checks against the declaration or
arity of the type constructor or the type arguments: see $get\_type\_info$ (q.v.).
=GFT Definition
mk_ctype ("tc", [”ty1®,”ty2®,...]) = ”(ty1,ty2,...)tc®
mk_ctype ("tc", [”ty®]) = ”ty tc®
mk_ctype ("tc", []) = ”tc®
=TEX
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûdest_ctypeÝ : TYPE -> string * TYPE list;
=DESCRIBE
Extract the components of a compound type.
=GFT Definition
dest_ctype ”(ty1,ty2,...)tc® = ("tc", [”ty1®,”ty2®,...])
dest_ctype ”ty tc® = ("tc", [”ty®])
dest_ctype ”tc® = ("tc", [])
=TEX
=FAILURE
3001	?0 is not a compound type
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûis_ctypeÝ : TYPE -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
Return true only when the type is a compound type, and false otherwise: no exceptions can be raised.
If the argument isn't a compound type then it must be a type variable.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûkey_mk_ctypeÝ : E_KEY * TYPE list -> TYPE;
val Ûkey_dest_ctypeÝ : TYPE -> E_KEY * TYPE list;
=DESCRIBE
Internally, the names of type constructors are represented using efficient dictionary keys.
These functions allow the creation and destruction of compound types by key rather than by name.
=ENDDOC
\subsubsection{Type Variables}
=DOC
val Ûmk_vartypeÝ : string -> TYPE;
=DESCRIBE
Create a HOL type variable from a string:
=GFT Definition
mk_vartype "'tv" = ” 'tv®
=TEX
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûdest_vartypeÝ : TYPE -> string;
=DESCRIBE
Extract the name of a type variable:
=GFT Definition
dest_vartype ” 'tv® = "'tv"
=TEX
=FAILURE
3019	?0 is not a type variable
3027	STRING STORE ERROR: cannot translate internal id (?0) to string
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûis_vartypeÝ : TYPE -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
Return true only when the type is a type variable, and false otherwise: no exceptions can be raised.
If the argument isn't a type variable then it must be a compound type.
=ENDDOC
\subsubsection{Function Types}
The following functions should be used in preference to
the ``ctype'' functions when handling function types.
=DOC
val Ûmk_­_typeÝ : (TYPE * TYPE) -> TYPE;
=DESCRIBE
Create a function type from two types.
A function type is just a kind of compound type.
=GFT Definition
mk_­_type (”ty1®, ”ty2®) =
	mk_ctype("­",[”ty1®,”ty2®]) = ”ty1 ­ ty2®
=TEX
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûdest_­_typeÝ : TYPE -> (TYPE * TYPE);
=DESCRIBE
Extract the two constituent types of a function type.
=GFT Definition
dest_­_type ”ty1 ­ ty2® = (”ty1®, ”ty2®)
=TEX
=FAILURE
3022	?0 is not of form: ”ty1 ­ ty2®
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûis_­_typeÝ : TYPE -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
Return true only when the type is a function type, i.e. of form  $”ty1\ ­\ ty2®$, and false otherwise: no exceptions can be raised.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Functions Upon the Type $TYPE$}
=DOC
val Ûinst_typeÝ : ((TYPE * TYPE) list) -> TYPE -> TYPE;
=DESCRIBE
$inst\_type$ $alist$ $type$ recursively descends through $type$, replacing any type variables by whatever the association list $alist$ associates with them.
If the association list does not contain a type variable found in $type$, then that type variable will not be changed.
Replaced types are {\bf not} recursively processed by this function.
=FAILURE
3019	?0 is not a type variable
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûtype_tyconsÝ : TYPE -> (string * int) list;
=DESCRIBE
This returns a list of names of type constructors, and the arity of their use, within a type.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûtype_tyvarsÝ : TYPE -> string list;
=DESCRIBE
Returns the list of type variable names present in a type.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûtype_anyÝ : (TYPE -> bool) -> TYPE -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
Given a predicate on types, tests to see if any sub-type of some type (or the type itself) satisfies the predicate.
The search ceases on the first satisfaction, rather than all the
tests being done and the results combined.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûtype_mapÝ : (TYPE -> TYPE) -> TYPE -> TYPE;
=DESCRIBE
$type\_map$ $tyfun$ $ty$ traverses
$ty$ (breadth first) looking for subtypes, $st$, for which
the application $tyfun\,st$ does not fail and replaces
such subtypes with $tyfun\,st$.
It does not traverse the resulting subtypes.
=ENDDOC
We unconventionally use an upper case name for the following
to avoid confusion with the ML type constructor $bool$,
and match the HOL type constructor name.
=DOC
val ÛBOOLÝ : TYPE;
=DESCRIBE
The HOL type of truth values:
=GFT Definition
val BOOL = ”BOOL®;
=TEX
=SEEALSO
Theory ``min''.
=ENDDOC
=TEX
\subsection{The Types $TERM$ and $DEST\_SIMPLE\_TERM$}
=DOC
eqtype ÛTERMÝ;
=DESCRIBE
This is the type of well-formed HOL terms.
Objects of this type are manipulated by term constructor, destructor and recogniser functions, such as $mk\_app$, $dest\_Ì$ and $is\_var$.
=ENDDOC

=DOC
val Û=$Ý : (TERM * TERM) -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
This is the (infix) equality test for HOL terms.
It is retained for backwards compatibility --- the type of HOL terms is now an equality type.

Instead of equality it is often preferable to test for
$Á$-convertibility, using
=INLINEFT
~=$
=TEX
=ENDDOC
=DOC
datatype ÛDEST_SIMPLE_TERMÝ =
	ÛVarÝ of string * TYPE
|	ÛConstÝ of string * TYPE
|	ÛAppÝ of TERM * TERM
|	ÛSimpleÌÝ of TERM * TERM;
=DESCRIBE
This is the simple type of destroyed terms, related to the type $TERM$ by
$dest\_simple\_term$(q.v.) and $mk\_simple\_term$(q.v.).
The four value constructors represented destroyed variables, constants, applications and simple $Ì$-abstractions respectively.
=USES
In writing pattern-matching functions upon HOL terms.
=SEEALSO
$DEST\_TERM$.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Primitive Functions Upon Terms}
=DOC
val Ûdest_simple_termÝ : TERM -> DEST_SIMPLE_TERM;
=DESCRIBE
An injective function, that destroys a term, returning its
top-level structure, and the associated constituent parts.
=SEEALSO
$DEST\_SIMPLE\_TERM$
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûmk_simple_termÝ : DEST_SIMPLE_TERM -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
Create a well-formed TERM from a statement of a top-level structure, and the associated constituent parts.

It makes the same checks as $mk\_const$, $mk\_app$, etc(q.v.),
and gives the same error messages as these if there is a failure.
=SEEALSO
$DEST\_SIMPLE\_TERM$
=FAILURE
3005	Cannot apply ?0 to ?1 as types are incompatible
3006	Type of ?0 not of form ”ty1 ­ ty2®
3007	?0 is not a term variable
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûtype_ofÝ : TERM -> TYPE;
=DESCRIBE
This gives the HOL type of a term.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Primitive Constructors and Destructors of the type $TERM$}
\subsubsection{Term Variables}
=DOC
val Ûmk_varÝ : (string * TYPE) -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
This produces a term variable.

The function makes no checks against the declaration of the subtypes of the type supplied.
=GFT Definition
mk_var("v",”ty®) = ¬v : ty®
=TEX
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûdest_varÝ: TERM -> (string * TYPE);
=DESCRIBE
This destroys a term variable into its name and type.
=FAILURE
3007	?0 is not a term variable
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûis_varÝ : TERM -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
Return true only when the term is a variable, and false otherwise: no exceptions can be raised.
=ENDDOC
\subsubsection{Constants}
=DOC
val Ûmk_constÝ : (string * TYPE) -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
This produces a constant.
=GFT Definition
mk_const("c",”ty®) = ¬c : ty®
=TEX

The function makes no checks against the declaration of the constant, the declaration of the type constructors of the type supplied, or the appropriateness of the type supplied: see $get\_const\_info$ (q.v.).
However it will not form constants whose types clash with those constants required by the implementation of the abstract data type $THM$ (q.v.).
These are $=$, $´$, $µ$, and $¶$.
=FAILURE
3002	Type of constant with name "=" must be of form:¬ty1 ­ ty1 ­ BOOL®
3003	Type of constant with name "´" must be of form:¬BOOL ­ BOOL ­ BOOL®
3004	Type of constant with name ?0 must be of form:¬(ty1 ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL®
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûdest_constÝ: TERM -> (string * TYPE);
=DESCRIBE
This destroys a constant into its name and type.
=FAILURE
3009	?0 is not a constant
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûis_constÝ : TERM -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
Return true only when the term is a constant, and false otherwise: no exceptions can be raised.
Note that even if the constant has not been declared,
or has an inappropriate type it will still satisfy this predicate.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûkey_mk_constÝ : (E_KEY * TYPE) -> TERM;
val Ûkey_dest_constÝ : TERM -> E_KEY * TYPE;
=DESCRIBE
Internally, the names of constants are represented using efficient dictionary keys.
These functions allow the creation and destruction of constants by key rather than by name.
=ENDDOC
\subsubsection{Applications}
=DOC
val Ûmk_appÝ : (TERM * TERM) -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
This produces a function application.
=GFT Definition
mk_app (¬f®, ¬t®) = ¬f t®
=TEX
Note that many derived term constructs, e.g. all quantifications,
are also applications.
Thus
=GFT Example
mk_app (¬$µ®, ¬Ì x · t®) = ¬µ x · t®
=TEX
=FAILURE
3005	Cannot apply ?0 to ?1 as types are incompatible
3006	Type of ?0 not of form ”ty1 ­ ty2®
=ENDDOC
The uses of this function in the parser, etc, should catch
this functions error messages, and give more meaningful ones.
=DOC
val Ûdest_appÝ: TERM -> (TERM * TERM);
=DESCRIBE
Destroys a function application into the function and argument.
Note that many derived term constructs, e.g. all quantifications,
are also applications.
=GFT Definition
dest_app ¬f t® = (¬f®, ¬t®)
dest_app ¬µ x · t® = (¬$µ®, ¬Ì x · t®)
=TEX
=FAILURE
3010	?0 is not of form: ¬t1 t2®
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûis_appÝ : TERM -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
Return true only when the term is a function application
(i.e. of form
=INLINEFT
¬f x®
=TEX
{}), and false otherwise: no exceptions can be raised.
Note that many derived term constructs, e.g. all quantifications,
are also applications.
Thus
=INLINEFT
is_app ¬µ x · t®
=TEX
{} will return $true$.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûlist_mk_appÝ : (TERM * TERM list) -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
Applies a function to multiple arguments.
=GFT Definition
list_mk_app (¬t®, [¬t1®,¬t2®,¬t3®,...]) = ¬t t1 t2 t3 ...®
=TEX
=FAILUREC
\paragraph{Failure}
May give rise to the error message from $mk\_app$.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûstrip_appÝ : TERM -> TERM * TERM list;
=DESCRIBE
Splits a term into a head term, that is not an application, and the list of argument terms, if any, to which that head term was applied.
=EXAMPLE
strip_app ¬t t1 t2 t3 ...® = (¬t®, [¬t1®,¬t2®,¬t3®,...])
strip_app ¬T® = (¬T®,[])
=ENDDOC
\subsubsection{Simple Ì-abstractions}
As noted in the terminology, ``simple'' is used to denote the
abstraction of a variable from a term.
=DOC
val Ûmk_simple_ÌÝ : (TERM * TERM) -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
This produces a simple $Ì$-abstraction.
It may only abstract variables.
=GFT Definition
mk_simple_Ì (¬v®, ¬t®) = ¬Ì v · t®
=TEX
=SEEALSO
$mk\_Ì$
=FAILURE
3007	?0 is not a term variable
=ENDDOC

\subsection{Generic Derived Term Structure Functions}
The following functions are provided to give a standard, generic, approach
to implementing various derived term manipulation functions.
For instance, the functions of section \ref{SpecificFunctions} will usually
be implemented by just a call to one of these functions.

A performance issue arises with the destructor functions for
derived term constructors: need they test the types of constants?
We do not make this test, and thus might give the ``wrong''
results with ill-formed terms.
It is not necessary to worry about this if we are only concerned about
saved theorems, etc, as these are checked for well-formedness of their constituents.
In addition, the constants required to implement the abstract data type $THM$ cannot occur with incorrect types, by
the mechanism of $mk\_const$.
Apart from this, some misleading results on handling terms could occur,
but no inconsistency arises.

\subsection{Literals}
There are three types of literal: numbers, strings and characters.
\subsubsection{Numeric Literals}

The representation of numeric literals is by HOL constants whose type
is $”î®$ and where the string component of the constant is entirely
decimal digits, the digits being the decimal representation of the
literal.

val Ûis_îÝ : TERM -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
Return true only when the term is a numeric literal (e.g. $¬5®$), and false otherwise: no exceptions can be raised.
=ENDDOC
\subsubsection{Character Literals}

Character literals are represented by HOL constants of type $”CHAR®$.
where the string component of the constant is exactly two characters
long, the first being the back-quotation~(~`~) and the second the
character itself.  The back-quotation~(~`~) is chosen as it is used in
the concrete syntax representation of character literals.

The construction and destruction functions have as argument and result
(respectively) a string holding a single character.  The back-quotation
is intended for use only in the internal representation of character
literals.  However, the internal representation will be returned by, e.g., a
call of $(simple\_)dest\_term$.

We unconventionally use an upper case name for the following
to match the treatment of ML variable $STRING$.

(e.g.
=INLINEFT
¬`a`®
=TEX
), and false otherwise: no exceptions can be raised.
=ENDDOC

\subsubsection{String Literals}

String literals are represented by HOL constants of type $”STRING®$
where the first character of string component of the constant is the
double-quote~(~{\tt"}~) and the remainder is the body of the string.
The double-quote~(~{\tt"}~) is chosen as it is used in the concrete
syntax representation of strings.

The construction and destruction functions have as argument and result
(respectively) the body of the string.  The double-quote is intended
for use only in the internal representation of strings.  However, the
internal representation will be returned by a call of,
e.g.
$(simple\_)dest\_term$.

We unconventionally use an upper case name for the following
to avoid confusion with the ML type constructor $string$,
and match the HOL type constructor name.
=DOC

val Ûgen_varsÝ : TYPE list -> TERM list -> TERM list;
=DESCRIBE
$gen\_vars$ $tyl$ $tml$ generates a list of differently named term
variables, with the types in $tyl$, whose names are not present within any of the terms in $tml$ as variable names.

It will be much faster to make one call to this function with a list of types, than to make the equivalent number of individual calls.

$variant$ $stoplist$ $v$ returns a variant of variable $v$
whose name is not used for any variable in $stoplist$
(which must be only variables).
The variants are generated by sufficient appending of the variant string (see $set\_variant\_string$).

$list\_variant$ $stoplist$ $vlist$ returns a list of variants of the list of variables $vlist$, whose names are not present in the $stoplist$, which is also a list of term variables.
No names are duplicated, the function returning one new variable for each member of $vlist$.
The variants are generated by sufficient appending of the variant string (see $set\_variant\_string$).

$is\_free\_in$ $v$ $term$ returns true iff. there is a free occurrence of $v$ in
$term$.
It will raise an exception if the first argument is not a term variable.

val Ûvar_substÝ : (TERM * TERM) list -> TERM -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
$var\_subst$ $alist$ $term$ returns the term formed by, for each pair in $alist$, substituting in $term$ all free instances of the term variable which is the second of the pair with the first of the pair.
The pair of the first matching term variable in the list will be used,
duplicates later in the list will be ignored.
Renaming may occur to prevent bound variable capture.

Note that the term variables must have the same types as the terms that are to replace them.

val ÛsubstÝ : (TERM * TERM) list -> TERM -> TERM;
=DESCRIBE
$subst$ $[(t_1, u_1), (t_2, u_2), \ldots]$ $t$ returns the term formed from $t$ by parallel substition of the $t_i$ for the $u_i$.
The $u_i$ can be variables or arbitrary terms but only ``free'' occurrences of a $u_i$ will be changed (i.e., only occurrences in which no free variable of $u_i$ becomes a bound variable in $t$).
Bound variables in $t$ are renamed as neccessary to prevent bound variable capture.

If some $u_i$ appears more than once in the substitution list, say $u_i = u_j$ for $i < j$, then the later pair $(t_j, u_j)$ is ignored.

$subst$ does not perform type instantiation: each $t_i$ must have the same type as the corresponding $u_i$..

$term\_map$ $tmfun$ $tm$ traverses
$tm$ (breadth first) looking for subterms for which
the application $tmfun\,tm$ does not fail and replaces
such subterms with $tmfun\,tm$.
It does not traverse the resulting subterms.
$tmfun$ has as its first argument a list giving
the bound variables which are in scope at the point of use.
It does not attempt to apply $tmfun$ to a bound variable of an abstraction.

Given a predicate on terms, tests to see if any sub-term of some term (or the term itself) satisfies the predicate.
The search ceases on the first satisfaction, rather than all the
tests being done and the results combined.

val ÛinstÝ : TERM list -> (TYPE * TYPE) list -> TERM -> TERM;

$inst$ $avlist$ $slist$ $term$ instantiates the type variables of $term$ with the associated types found in $slist$.
An element of $slist$ will be ($return$, $tv$),
where $tv$ is a type variable that is to be instantiated to $return$.
It will rename bound variables as necessary to prevent name capture problems.
It will also not allow free variables to become the same as those in the avoidance list, $avlist$, or to become bound.

It partially evaluates with two arguments.

\subsection{Formatting and Failing With Terms and Types}
For SML'97, $makestring$ which supported $string\_of\_term$ and
$string\_of\_type$ is not available. We provide the following interfaces,
not intended for end user consumption to let us do without $makestring$.
$string\_of\_TTT$ picks up the function to do the printing from a variable
managed by $pp'set\_string\_of\_TTT$. This is initially set to
$pp'string\_of\_TTT$, which provides a very crude format. When the proper
pretty printer is available, it can be installed with $pp'set\_string\_of\_TTT$.

$term\_fail$ $area$ $msg$ $tml$ first creates a list of functions from $unit$ to $string$, using $string\_of\_term$ (q.v.) providing displays of the list of terms.
It then calls $fail$ with the $area$, $msg$ and this list of functions.
This allows terms to be presented in error messages.

\section{TEST POLICY}
In \cite{DS/FMU/IED/PLN008} there is a statement of the general principle of testing to be adopted.
This section gives some individual comments on special testing requirements for individual functions.

A key problem in the functions provided is to ensure that
free variable capture does not occur.
That is, due to some change, a variable that was free, becomes unintentionally bound.
