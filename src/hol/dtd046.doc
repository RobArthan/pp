\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
Tools supporting specification of constants will be required in ICL HOL
and will be called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD010}.
This document contains a quick hack which will stand for the finished
tools for experimental purposes.
\subsection{Introduction}
\section{Preamble}
=DOC
signature ConstantSpecification  = sig
=DESCRIBE
This is the signature of a structure supporting specification of
constants.
=ENDDOC
\section{$new\_defn$}
=DOC
val ânew_defná : string list * TERM -> THM
=DESCRIBE
$new\_defn(keys,»tm¼)$ introduces a new constant into the
current theory with 
its defining theorem derived from $tm$ as explained
below, saving the definition under the keys $keys$.
$tm$ is expected to have one of the following forms:
ó
	ƒx1 x2 ... xmŽx v1 v2 ... vn = t
æ
Either of $m$ or $n$ here may be 0. The $v_i$ must all be
allowed variable structures. $x$ must not appear free in $t$ or in the $x_i$.
The new constant has the same name and type as the variable $x$.
=FAILURE
46000	Defining term contains the following free variables ?0 *)
46001	Defining term ?0 is not a (possibly universally quantified) equation
46002	The left hand side of the defining equation must have the form
	»x¼ or »x a1 ... ak¼, where »x¼ is a variable
46003	?0 appears twice as a dummy argument
46004	?0 is not a variable or variable structure
46005	RHS of definition must not contain free variables which do not appear
	on the LHS (?0)
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val âHOL_axiomatic_recogniserá : string * string * Lex.INPUT list * string -> THM
=DESCRIBE
Description TBA
=FAILURE
46010	The defining predicate must be a (universally quantified) equation
46011	The value defined by the predicate is not the same as the value
	in the signature part
46012	The signature and predicate must be supplied as a pair
