\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
Tools supporting specification of constants will be required in ICL HOL
and are called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD010}.This document provides a detailed design for these tools.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the
tools supporting specification of constants.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This document depends upon the paired-abstraction inference rules of
\cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD027}.
The theory design given in this document refers to material to be  added into theory ``misc'' (See \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD023})
this document cannot be processed to give a complete
theory design.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
None known.
\subsubsection{Conventions}
The tools described in this document work best when certain conventions are obeyed.
All ICL supplied material will follow these conventions, though 
the user may choose to break convention, though we would advise against it.

These conventions are that:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Any definition will be saved under at least the keys that are the
defined constant's names, and that additional keys are not, and will not be the names
of other constants.
\item
If a predicate used in $const\_spec$ is proven
consistent by hand then the result is of the form `$ô$ $Consistent$
$(Ì (x1,...,xn)\ ·\ p$', and is saved under the keys
$x1\_consistent$, ..., $xn\_consistent$
(with the case of the constant within the key remaining unchanged).
\end{itemize}
\section{METHODS AND ISSUES}

There are some theoretical and practical
issues to be taken into account in designing tools
to support specification.

Ideally we would like to let the user define object
language constants by giving arbitrary
predicates.
The resulting theories would, in general, be inconsistent.
(i.e. it would be possible to prove $F$ in them).
Moreover, there is no decision procedure to determine
whether or not an arbitrary predicate gives
rise to a consistent (or conservative)
extension.
The conservative extension mechanism $new\_spec$, 
of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD012},
therefore, imposes a restriction on the predicates which
may be used and require the user to supply a theorem
of a certain form, which can be viewed as justifying
the consistency of the definition.
(In an appendix (\ref{COUNTEREXAMPLES} below) we give
some examples which show the need for the restrictions
on the predicates).

The main concern in this document is to enable the
user to defer the task of proving the consistency
of his specification until the specification is
complete. To do this we turn each defining
predicate supplied by the user into one which
can automatically be proved consistent and which is
coextensive with the user's predicate
provided that is consistent.
We also
try to prove the consistency automatically by a tool indicated by the current proof context (see \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD051}), so as to
simplify the definition which is actually stored
on the theory.

The details of the conservative extension interfaces
prevent us from making the defining theorems for
constants in the precise forms usually
required by the user. As an expedient we supply an
interface function, $get\-\_speci\-fication$,
(analagous to $get\-\_defn$),
which derives a theorem in a convenient form from
the defining theorem.
\section{FUTURE WORK}
The ``fast'' mode of the constant specification tool,
with an always failing function is both a bit crude, and not
necessarily sufficiently fast.
Two further modes of use could be implemented. 
The first uses only $new\_const$ on the appropriate names, saving no theorems at all.
This only has use when no reasoning at all is intended 
about the constants
(e.g. in a type-checking only mode).
The second uses $new\_const$ and $new\_axiom$ to introduce the
defining property, rather than relying on an assumption
or automated proof tool. 
It would allow all the reasoning that could be done
with a discharged proof obligation, at the cost of possible 
inconsistency due to the introduction of an axiom.

\section{THE DESIGN}
\subsection{Specification of Constants by Terms}
=DOC
val ÛHOL_const_recogniserÝ : string * string * Lex.INPUT list * string
	-> THM;
=DESCRIBE
From the argument (which will be supplied by the reader/writer)
this function will derive a list of varstructs, and a predicate.
These will then be passed to $const\_spec$ (q.v.)
which will attempt the requested specification.
The keys under which the result will be saved are just the names 
of the variables concerned.
=USES
As an interface between the HOL reader/writer and $const\-\_spec$ - it is not intended for
direct use.
It is used to process text of the form
=GFT Example Constant Specification
	decls
÷
	pred

=FAILURE
46000	Input not of right form
=FAILUREC
Errors from $const\_spec$ may also occur: the messages area of origin will not be changed.
=ENDDOC
=THDOC
req_const("Consistent",¬:('a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL®);
req_defn(["Consistent", "consistent_def"],([],¬µ p:'a ­ BOOL · Consistent p ¤ ¶ x · p x®));
=DESCRIBE
The constant $ÛConsistentÝ$ is used to express the fact that
a predicate is satisfiable.
=ENDDOC
=THDOC
req_const("ConstSpec",¬:('a ­ BOOL) ­ 'a ­ BOOL®);
req_defn(["ConstSpec","const_spec_def"],([],
	¬µ (p:'a ­ BOOL) (c:'a) · 
	ConstSpec p c ¤ (Consistent p ´ p c)®);
=DESCRIBE
The constant $ÛConstSpecÝ$ applied to $p$ and $c$ is used to express the fact that
if the predicate $p$ is consistent (see $Consistent$)
then $c$ satisfies the predicate.
=ENDDOC
=THDOC
req_thm("const_spec_thm",([],
	¬µ (p:'a ­ BOOL) · ¶ x : 'a · ConstSpec p x®));
=DESCRIBE
The theorem ``$Ûconst\_spec\_thmÝ$'' expresses the fact that 
there always exists something that satisfies $ConstSpec$ applied to any predicate (whether consistent or not).
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûconsistent_defÝ: THM;
val Ûconst_spec_defÝ:THM;
val Ûconst_spec_thmÝ: THM;
=DESCRIBE
These theorems are ML variables bound to the definition of $Consistent$, the definition of $ConstSpec$ and the theorem saved with key $const\_spec\_thm$
in theory ``misc''.
=GFT
val consistent_def = ô µ p · Consistent p ¤ ¶ x · p x
val const_spec_def = ô µ p c· ConstSpec p c ¤ (Consistent p ´ p c)
val const_spec_thm = ô µ p · ¶ x : 'a · ConstSpec p x
=TEX
=ENDDOC
In the following we allow a list of arbitrary variable structures
just for the convenience of calling functions and the user.
A list of variables would be sufficient, pushing pre-processing elsewhere.
=DOC
val Ûconst_specÝ : string list * TERM list * TERM -> THM;
=DESCRIBE
$const\_spec$ $(keys$, $varstructs$, $predicate)$
declares constants matching the names and types of those in $varstructs$, with the property that, if $predicate$
holds for some list of values, then it holds for the constants
in question,
with the definition saved under each of $keys$.
In addition, if the existence prover held in the current proof context, and accessed by $current\_cs\_¶\_conv$, can
prove the predicate is satisfied for some witness
(i.e. $¤\ T$), the
specification will instead be made without the caveat.
In more detail, if the list of free variables in $varstructs$ is
$c_1$ $...$ $c_n$, and the predicate is of the form $P[$ $c_1$ $...$ $c_n$ $]:BOOL$, then the specification of constants $c_1$ $...$ $c_n$
(with same names and types as the variables)
will be:
=GFT
ô ConstSpec (Ì (x_1, ..., x_n) · P[x1,...,xn]) (c1,...,cn)
=TEX
where each $x_i$ is a variant (see $list\_variant$) of $c_i$, not present in the original list of variables, or the predicate,
and the $c_i$ become constants.
However, if we can automatically prove:
=INLINEFT
¶ c1 ... cn · P[c1,...,cn]
=TEX
Then instead the specification will be:
=INLINEFT
ô P [c1,...,cn]
=TEX
There are a number of caveats on the production of the specification:
there must be no duplicates in $varstructs$;
all the constant's types must have the same set of type variables;
there must be no type variables in the body of $predicate$ other
than those already in the constant's types;
and there must be at least one key.

val Ûget_specÝ : string -> THM;
=DESCRIBE
$get\_spec$ $const$ will find the (first) definition in scope
stored under key $const$, in the theory in which the in-scope constant named $const$ was defined.
If ICL conventions have been followed, then such a definition should be the definition of the constant named $const$.
In addition, there can only be one definition of a particular constant in scope (though the conventional key might be used elsewhere, or not at all).
If there is no such constant in scope, or no definition with the given key, then the function fails.

If the definitional theorem is not of the form:
=GFT
ô ConstSpec p c
=TEX
then the theorem is returned un-processed - if properly saved then it either comes from
$(simple\_)$ $new\-\_defn$ , $new\-\_speci\-fication$, or predicate $p$ was automatically proven
consistent by $const\-\_spec$.

Otherwise, the function will seek for a theorem stored with key
$const$ $\verb"^"$ ``$\_consistent$'', starting at the theory in which the definition was found, and working ``out'' to the current theory.
If conventions have been followed this theorem should be of the form:
=GFT
‡ ô Consistent p
=TEX
(Ideally there should be no assumptions in the theorem, but
the function caters for their presence.)
If a theorem of this form is found then the function returns:
=GFT
%beta%_rule `‡ ô p c`
=TEX
If not, then the function returns a theorem of the form:
=GFT
%beta%_rule `Consistent p ô p c`
=TEX
=SEEALSO

46005	There is no constant with name ?0 in scope
46006	There is no definition with key ?0 in scope
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Supporting the Conventions}
To help follow the conventions on consistency theorems we provide
the following two functions:
=DOC
val Ûpush_consistency_goalÝ: string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$push\_consistency\_goal$ $const$ will 
first determine the specification theorem of $nm$,
by executing $get\_spec$.
If this theorem has an assumption,
it will then push that specification assumption onto the stack of subgoals (using $push\_subgoal$, q.v.), as a goal with no assumptions.
By how $get\_spec$ is designed, this (single) assumption
will be of the form
=GFT
¬Consistent (Ì vs[x1,...,xn]·p[x1,...,xn])®
=TEX
or the consistency has already been proven, and saved, under some assumptions.
Only in the former case will the function continue:
it will apply a tactic (that may be undone by $undo$) which
rewrites the goal to precisely:
=GFT
([], ¬¶ vs[x1,...,xn]·p[x1,...,xn]®)
=TEX
If not, the function fails.
=SEEALSO
$save\_consistency\_thm$ to save the result in a conventional manner.
=FAILURE
46005	There is no constant with name ?0 in scope
46006	There is no definition with key ?0 in scope
46007	Specification of ?0 is not of the form: `Consistent (Ì vs[x1,...,xn]·p[x1,...,xn]) ô ...`
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûsave_consistency_thmÝ : string -> THM -> THM;
=DESCRIBE
$save\_consistency\_thm$ $nm$ $thm$ expects $thm$ to be of the form
=GFT
‡ ô Consistent (Ì vs[x1,...,xn]·p[x1,...,xn])
=TEX
where $vs$ forms a varstruct from the simple variables $x_i$.
The predicate proven consistent is then expected to be the same
as predicate in the $const\_spec$ definition of $nm$.
If so, the theorem will be saved under the keys
$c1\_consistent$, ..., $cn\_consistent$,
where the $c_i$ are the names of all the constants defined in the 
definition in question.

Ideally there should be no assumptions in the theorem, but
the function caters for their presence.
=SEEALSO
$push\_consistency\_goal$ to set a goal suitable for saving with this theorem.
=FAILURE
6037	Theory ?0 is locked
6039	Key ?0 has already been used for a theorem in theory ?1
6071	Theory ?0 is a read-only ancestor
46005	There is no constant with name ?0 in scope
46006	There is no definition with key ?0 in scope
46008	?0 is not of the form: ¬Consistent (Ì vs[x1,...,xn]·p[x1,...,xn])®
46011	?0 does not match definition of ?1
46012	?0 is not of the form: ¬ConstSpec p c®
=FAILUREC
If even one key causes a failure, the theorem will not be saved at all (the behaviour of $list\_save\_thm$).

\appendix
\section{COUNTEREXAMPLES} \label{COUNTEREXAMPLES}
The conditions imposed by the primitive
conservative extension mechanisms.
lead to restrictions on the forms of predicates
allowed in constant specifications. Examples showing the need for these
restrictions are given in this appendix.

The restrictions which are imposed on constant
specifications are that no types appear in the predicate
which do not appear in the type of each new constant
and that the predicate contains no free variables other
than those corresponding to the new constants (this latter
restriction being taken to mean that the universal
closure over any such variables is used if necessary).

To understand the restrictions on the types consider
the following:
=GFT Example of Restriction on Types in Constant Specification
	c : BOOL,
÷
	c ¤ (¶x y:'a·³(x = y)

If this were allowed, then there would be no
difficulty in proving the consistency proposition and
the defining theorem resulting would be:
=GFT Example Defining Theorem
ô	c ¤ (¶x y:'a·³(x = y)
=TEX
By instantiating ``$:'a$'' to the one element type ``$:ONE$'
and the two element type ``$:BOOL$'', we could
could infer the following theorems
=GFT Example Theorems
ô	c ¤ (¶x y:ONE·³(x = y)
ô	c ¤ F
ô	³c
=TEX
and 
=GFT Example Theorems
ô	c ¤ (¶x y:BOOL·³(x = y)
ô	c ¤ T
ô	c
=TEX
Thus the resulting theory is inconsistent.

To understand the restrictions on the free variables consider
the following:
=GFT Example of Restriction on Types in Constant Specification
	d : BOOL,
÷
	d ¤ x

(where x is a variable). Again the consistency
proposition would be easy to prove and this would lead to the following
defining theorem:
=GFT Example Defining Theorem
ô	d ¤ x
=TEX
By instantiating $x$ here to $T$ and then $F$ we may
derive the contradictory theorems:
=GFT Example Theorems
ô	d
ô	³d
=TEX
and again we have an inconsistent theory.
