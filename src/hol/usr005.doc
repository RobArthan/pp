\chapter{ABOUT THIS PUBLICATION} \label{intro}
\section{Purpose}

This document, one of several making up the user documentation for the \Product\ system, is the description manual for the system.
\section{Readership}

This document provides descriptions of the facilities offered by \Product.
It is not a tutorial for learning the basic use of the system.

\section{Related Publications}

A bibliography is given at the end of this document.
Publications relating specifically to \Product\ are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em TUTORIAL}: \cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR004}, a volume of tutorial material for \Product.
\item {\em REFERENCE}: \cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR006}, a volume containing detailed description of each individual facility provided in the metalanguage to the user of \Product;
\item Supplementary Guides: a collection of documents on special topics, notably the Installation Guide, \cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR007}.
\end{enumerate}

The first two of these publications will be referred to as the  \TUTORIAL\ and the \REFERENCE\ throughout.  

%\section{Area Covered}

\section{Assumptions}

Though it is not strictly prerequisite, the use may find this volume easier to read after attending a course on \Product, or after consulting \TUTORIAL.

\section{Acknowledgements}

The \Product\ system is a proof tool for Higher Order Logic which builds upon and extends the ideas arising from research carried out over a long period at the Universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh, and elsewhere.

Although \Product\ is a completely new implementation, it would not have been possible without the academic research relating to the Cambridge HOL system.

\chapter{USER INTERFACE}

The contents of this section will be as indicated below.

\begin{itemize}
\item Services provided at the interface to the host operating system.
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item Standard ML.  What is documented here is what the user needs to
	know to get into {\SML} in order subsequently to run the proof
	development system, as opposed to what the user needs to know
	to get into {\SML} in general.   This might be nothing.
\item customization of screen and keyboard  to handle extended character sets.  What is documented here is how to switch on the facility, and what is the extended character set  and keyboard layout.
\item preparation of literate scripts using standard text-editors, with
	or without extended character sets.  What is documented here is
	the use of the extended characters which are special delimiters
	to mark off fragments, boxes etc. and all the \LaTeX macros
	which are provided to represent pretty characters or for other
	purposes.
\item printing of literate scripts. What is documented here is how to get the fonts set up and how to use the preprocessors.
\end{enumerate}
\item Services provided at the interface to \SML.
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item The proof development system, as constituted by all the defined {\SML} objects  documented in the body of the
 Reference Manual.  What might be documented here is the naming-conventions of \Cyte{DEF003}.
\item input of HOL terms via the parser.  What is documented here is the use of  special quotes to invoke the parser and the BNF of the grammar of HOL terms, as in \Cyte{DEF001}.
\item Use of the Z-like specification features, e.g. for $new\_specification$, for input of certain {\SML} expressions  and the automatically-performed proofs.   See  \Cyte{HLD010}.
\item customization of the parser for user-defined lexis. See \Cyte{DEF001}
\item output of HOL terms (via the pretty-printer).  What is to be documented here is what are the options for outputting a term. (Pretty-printed or not, with or without explicit types, etc, and how the pretty-printing may be customized ).
\item input of  \SML text stripped out of a literate script. What is documented here is how to invoke the process, and what are the conditions on the literate script for it to be successful.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
