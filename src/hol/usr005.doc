\chapter{ABOUT THIS PUBLICATION} \label{intro}
\section{Purpose}

This document, one of several making up the user documentation for the \Product\ system, is the description manual for the system.
\section{Readership}

This document will eventually provide a narrative description of {\Product} to complement the catalogue of detail provided by the {\REFERENCE}.
It is at present incomplete, containing only those parts of its intended content which are least well covered by other {\Product} user documentation.
Specifically, this version of the manual described the concrete syntax of the specification languages supported by {\Product}.

\section{Related Publications}

A bibliography is given at the end of this document.

Publications relating specifically to \Product\ are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em \ {\TUTORIAL}}, tutorial covering the basic \Product{} system.
\item {\em \ {\ZTUTORIAL}}, tutorial covering \Product{} Z support option.
\item {\em \ {\HTUTORIAL}};
\item {\em \ {\REFERENCE}};
\item {\em \ {\INSTALLATION}};
\item {\em \ {\TYPESETTING}}.
\end{enumerate}

Since the user documentation is as yet incomplete \cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR001} is made available with the \Product{} system to cover some of the areas not yet fully addressed by user documentation.

\section{Assumptions}

Though it is not strictly prerequisite, the user may find this volume easier to read after attending a course on {\Product}, or after consulting the \TUTORIAL.

\section{Acknowledgements}

ICL gratefully acknowledges its debt to the many researchers (both academic and industrial) who have provided intellectual capital on which ICL has drawn in the development of \Product.

We are particularly indebted to Mike Gordon of The University of Cambridge, for his leading role in some of the research on which the development of \Product\ has built, and for his positive attitude towards industrial exploitation of his work.

The \Product\ system is a proof tool for Higher Order Logic which builds upon ideas arising from research carried out at the Universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh, and elsewhere.

In particular the logic supported by the system is (at an abstract level) identical to that implemented in the Cambridge HOL system \cite{gordon93}, and the paradigm adopted for implementation of proof support for the language follows that adopted by Cambridge HOL, originating with the LCF system developed at Edinburgh \cite{gordon79}.
The functional language ``standard ML'' used both for the implementation and as a interactive metalanguage for proof development, originates in work at Edinburgh, and has been developed to its present state by an international group of academic and industrial researchers.
The implementation of Standard ML on which \Product\ is based was itself originally implemented by David Matthews at the University of Cambridge, and is now commercially marketed by Abstract Hardware Limited.

The \Product{} system also supports specification and proof in the Z language, developed at the University of Oxford.
We are therefore also indebted to the research at Oxford (and elsewhere) which has contributed to the development of the Z language.

\chapter{USER INTERFACE}

The contents of this section will be as indicated below.

\begin{itemize}
\item Services provided at the interface to the host operating system.
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item Standard ML.  What is documented here is what the user needs to
	know to get into {\SML} in order subsequently to run the proof
	development system, as opposed to what the user needs to know
	to get into {\SML} in general.   This might be nothing.
\item customization of screen and keyboard  to handle extended character sets.  What is documented here is how to switch on the facility, and what is the extended character set  and keyboard layout.
\item preparation of literate scripts using standard text-editors, with
	or without extended character sets.  What is documented here is
	the use of the extended characters which are special delimiters
	to mark off fragments, boxes etc. and all the \LaTeX macros
	which are provided to represent pretty characters or for other
	purposes.
\item printing of literate scripts. What is documented here is how to get the fonts set up and how to use the preprocessors.
\end{enumerate}
\item Services provided at the interface to \SML.
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item The proof development system, as constituted by all the defined {\SML} objects  documented in the body of the
 Reference Manual.  What might be documented here is the naming-conventions of \Cyte{DEF003}.
\item input of HOL terms via the parser.  What is documented here is the use of  special quotes to invoke the parser and the BNF of the grammar of HOL terms, as in \Cyte{DEF001}.
\item Use of the Z-like specification features, e.g. for $new\_specification$, for input of certain {\SML} expressions  and the automatically-performed proofs.   See  \Cyte{HLD010}.
\item customization of the parser for user-defined lexis. See \Cyte{DEF001}
\item output of HOL terms (via the pretty-printer).  What is to be documented here is what are the options for outputting a term. (Pretty-printed or not, with or without explicit types, etc, and how the pretty-printing may be customized ).
\item input of  \SML text stripped out of a literate script. What is documented here is how to invoke the process, and what are the conditions on the literate script for it to be successful.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{THE METALANGUAGE}

{\Product} has been implemented using PolyML, an implementation of Standard ML \cite{harper88}.

PolyML provides some extensions to the standard which have been used in the implementation of {\Product}.

These include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
A persistent database.
\item
Means of supporting quotation and pretty printing of object languages.
\end{itemize}

These extensions have been used in the development of {\Product} to achieve the following effects:

\begin{itemize}
\item
The theory heirarchy is held securely in the persistent database.
\item
The character set accepted in the metalanguage (ML) has been extended by including appropriate logical and mathematical symbols.
These extensions to the character set are mainly treated as new alphabetic characters and may therefore appear in ML variable names.
\item
Facilities have been provided for quotation of object language expressions and for automatic pretty-printing of values which represent such expressions.
\end{itemize}

To ensure that the {\Product} theory heirarchy is properly maintained, some of the effects normally obtained by commands supplied with PolyML should be obtained using alternative commands supplied with {\Product}.
Users of ProofPower should only use the supplied {\Product} function instead of the corresponding PolyML function whenever they are operating on a {\Product} database.

{\Product} users should use the UNIX command $€hol\_make\_database›$ instead of $€PolyML.make\_database›$.

Superseded ML functions are:

\begin{centering}

\begin{tabular}{l | l}
Use ProofPower Command & Instead of	PolyML command\\\hline
$€save\_and\_quit›$ & $€PolyML.commit›$ \\
$€quit›$ & $€PolyML.quit›$ \\
$€use\_file›$ & $€PolyML.use›$
\end{tabular}

\end{centering}

Full details of the {\Product} versions of these commands may be found in the {\REFERENCE}.

{\Product} users should not use the following Poly/ML functions on {\Product} databases:

\begin{itemize}
\item
$€PolyML.make›$
\item
$€PolyML.install\_pp›$
\item
$€PolyML.compiler›$
\end{itemize}
