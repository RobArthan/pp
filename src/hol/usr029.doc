\chapter{ABOUT THIS PUBLICATION} \label{intro}
\section{Purpose}

This document, one of several making up the user documentation for the \Product\ system, is the reference manual for the system.
\section{Readership}

This document is intended to be consulted by users already acquainted with the basic principles behind {\Product} who need detailed information on the behaviour of specific facilities provided by the system.
It is not a tutorial for learning the basic  use of the system.
A `keyword in context' index is supplied, which is useful for identifying the full range of facilities of a particular kind, provided that the reader is familiar with the naming conventions adopted in the development of \Product.


\section{Related Publications}

A bibliography is given at the end of this document.
Publications relating specifically to \Product\ are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em \ {\TUTORIAL}}, tutorial covering the basic \Product{} system.
\item {\em \ {\INSTALLATION}};
\item {\em \ {\TYPESETTING}}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Assumptions}

It is assumed that the reader has some prior acqaintance with {\Product} either by attending a course on {\Product} or by reading the tutorial.

\section{Acknowledgements}

ICL gratefully acknowledges its debt to the many researchers (both academic and industrial) who have provided intellectual capital on which ICL has drawn in the development of \Product.

We are particularly indebted to Mike Gordon of The University of Cambridge, for his leading role in some of the research on which the development of \Product\ has built, and for his positive attitude towards industrial exploitation of his work.

The \Product\ system is a proof tool for Higher Order Logic which builds upon ideas arising from research carried out at the Universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh, and elsewhere. 
In particular the logic supported by the system is (at an abstract level) identical to that implemented in the Cambridge HOL system \cite{gordon93}, and the paradigm adopted for implementation of proof support for the language follows that adopted by Cambridge HOL, originating with the LCF system developed at Edinburgh \cite{gordon79}.
The functional language `Standard ML' used both for the implementation and as an interactive metalanguage for proof development, originates in work at Edinburgh, and has been developed to its present state by an international group of academic and industrial researchers.
The implementation of Standard ML on which \Product\ is based was itself originally implemented by David Matthews at the University of Cambridge, and is now commercially marketed by Abstract Hardware Limited.

\chapter{USER INTERFACE}

The contents of this section will be as indicated below.

\begin{itemize}
\item Services provided at the interface to the host operating system.
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item Standard ML.  What is documented here is what the user needs to
	know to get into {\SML} in order subsequently to run the proof
	development system, as opposed to what the user needs to know
	to get into {\SML} in general.   This might be nothing.
\item customization of screen and keyboard  to handle extended character sets.  What is documented here is how to switch on the facility, and what is the extended character set  and keyboard layout.
\item preparation of literate scripts using standard text-editors, with
	or without extended character sets.  What is documented here is
	the use of the extended characters which are special delimiters
	to mark off fragments, boxes etc. and all the \LaTeX macros
	which are provided to represent pretty characters or for other
	purposes.
\item printing of literate scripts. What is documented here is how to get the fonts set up and how to use the preprocessors.
\end{enumerate}
\item Services provided at the interface to \SML.
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item The proof development system, as constituted by all the defined {\SML} objects  documented in the body of the
 Reference Manual.  What might be documented here is the naming-conventions of \Cyte{DEF003}.
\item input of HOL terms via the parser.  What is documented here is the use of  special quotes to invoke the parser and the BNF of the grammar of HOL terms, as in \Cyte{DEF001}.
\item customization of the parser for user-defined lexis. See \Cyte{DEF001}
\item output of HOL terms (via the pretty-printer).  What is to be documented here is what are the options for outputting a term. (Pretty-printed or not, with or without explicit types, etc, and how the pretty-printing may be customized ).
\item input of  \SML text stripped out of a literate script. What is documented here is how to invoke the process, and what are the conditions on the literate script for it to be successful.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{HOL TYPES AND TERMS}

\section{Syntactic Manipulations}

It should be noted that the functions documented in this section
are drawn from two signatures, $TypesAndTerms$ and $pp'TypesAndTerms$.

Since the former includes the latter, an object available under the
name $xxx$, say, or in full $TypesAndTerms.xxx$, is also available
under the name $pp'TypesAndTerms.xxx$. {} It is the intention that
users should not access objects by names of the form
$pp'TypesAndTerms.xxx$.
In practice, since the structure $TypesAndTerms$ is open, the unqualified name $xxx$ will do unless you have redefined the name $xxx$.

Our aim is to build a column with four pieces:
	(1)~Text before the indexed word;
	(2)~Vertical rule;
	(3)~Indexed word plus following text;
	(4)~Page number.
To do this need to calculate some widths.  We have a width of
\verb|\hsize| for these pieces.  For the page number we allocate a
space of five digits

=TEX
\newdimen\NUMWD
\setbox0=\hbox{0}%		% All digits are the same width
\NUMWD=5\wd0%			% Allow five digits

=IGN

The text fields use most of the remaining space.

The macro \verb|\LINE| above is, unfortunately, large and nasty but
this seems necessary given the output we wish to achieve.  The list
below discusses various features of the macro where the paragraph
labels relate to comments on the body of the macro.

\begin{description}

\item[General ] --- Percent signs are placed at the end of most of the
	lines `just in case'.  We are building a set of nested boxes
	where we want to be careful to exclude `rubbish' spaces which
	may upset the carefully made width calculations.

\item[A1, A2, A3 ] --- The baselines of these three items are carefully
	chosen so that names appear to flow across the vertical bar and
	then into the page number regardless of where line breaks are
	placed.  However, see C1 and C2.

\item[B1, B2 ] --- The \verb|\noindent| starts \Tex's horizontal mode,
	i.e., its paragraph building mode.  The paragraph completes at
	the closing curly bracket.

\item[C1, C2, C3 ] --- The penalties prevent unwanted line breaks that
	occured during development.

\item[D1, D2, D3, D4 ] --- The \verb|\strut| makes sure that the top
	and bottom lines of both sides have at least the normal height
	and depth for the currect baseline setting.

\item[E1, E2, E3, E4 ] --- Discretionary line breaking is wanted at
	various places, the arguments to macro \verb|\LINE| include
	calls of~`\verb|\-|' where it is allowed.

\item[F1, F2 ] --- Calls of \verb|\relax| are included to prevent
	getting the equivalent of~`\$\$' (i.e., start of display math)
	when an argument is empty.

\item[G1, G2 ] --- A zero width box sticks out to the right of the
	right hand text to include the page number.  The \verb|\hss|
	consumes the width of the included box.  Space for the included
	box was carefully allocated in the width calculations before
	the macro.

\item[H1 ] --- A final \verb|\hfill| fills out the space occupied by
	the page number to make the box \verb|\COLWD| wide.

Each indentifier in the index of the previous section has multiple
entries in this `KeyWord In Context' index, one entry per word or
significant component of the identifier, which are determined as
follows.  A word starts: (1)~after an underscore or a prime; (2)~with a
capital letter followed by a lower case letter; (3)~with a capital
letter which is preceded by a lower case letter.

Each `keyword in context' index entry has three parts: (1)~the
characters before the indexing word are shown to the left of the
vertical line; (2)~the indexing word plus any following characters are
shown to the right of the vertical line; (3)~the page number where the
indentifier is
defined.
