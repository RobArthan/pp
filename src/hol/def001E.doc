To ease the use of complicated types, a name (with a possibly empty
list of {\em type parameters})
may be declared as a {\em type abbreviation}.
A name which has been declared
as a type abbreviation may be used either
as a {\em Name} in the production for $Ty$ in section~\ref{Types}
above, or, if an infix declaration for the name is in force, as an
$InTyOp$.

For example, if the name $auto$, with the single parameter
$'a$ had been declared as an abbreviation for the function
type $'a ­ 'a$. Then $(bool)auto$ would denote the same type
as $bool­bool$.
