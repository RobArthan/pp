\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains detailed designs
for the theories ``sum'', ``one'' and ``combin'',
called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD011}.
The design is implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP045}.

\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains the detailed design for the theories ``basic$\_$hol'', ``sum'', ``one'', ``combin'', ``hol''.

These respectively:
\begin{description}
\item [basic$\_$hol]
This theory is the minimum theory in which consistency can be
guaranteed, due to primitive inference rules requiring
the presence of certain types and constants that are
not all present until this point.
The theory itself contains a small quantity of utility material.
\item [sum]
Define the sum type (i.e. binary disjoint union).
\item [one]
Defines a one-point type.
\item [combin]
Defines the combinators $CombS$, $CombK$ and $CombI$
and the functional composition operator $o$.
\item [hol]
This theory will be the starting theory for a user that wants access to
all the ICL supplied theories.
The theory itself is empty.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This document depends on \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP040}, which is the theory of characters,
and the theory design tools of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD035}.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
The three inhabited theories are missing some already obvious theorem
members, and it may be appropriate to add others
as development and application work progresses.

\section{THE THEORY ``basic$\_$hol''}
\subsection{Design of the theory ``basic$\_$hol''}
=THDOC
req_name "basic_hol" (Value "char");
=DESCRIBE
The theory ``Ûbasic\_holÝ'' is the minimum theory in which consistency can be

The theory ``ÛcombinÝ'' defines the combinators $CombS$, $CombK$ and $CombI$
and the functional composition operator $o$.
=ENDDOC
If a user intends to make significant use of the combinators
they may wish to alias $Comb$ to $S$, etc.
The combinators are not given their usual one letter names to preserve
these for use as variable names.

end;
=DESCRIBE
In the signature of $CombinTheory$ in which we declare theory ``combin'' we bind the definitions of $CombS$, $CombK$, $CombI$ and $o$ to
$comb\_s\_def$, $comb\_k\_def$, $comb\_i\_def$ and $o\_def$ respectively.
The theorem  saved with key ``$o\_assoc\_thm$'' is bound to
the ML value of the same name, as is ``$o\_i\_thm$''.

because they won't be in common use.

The representation of a value of type $”'a\ +\ 'b®$ is
by a triple, where in the implementation the third member indicates whether
the first or second member is the ``real'' value of the type.
This is expressed by the constant $ÛIsSumRepÝ$ whose definition

\section{TEST POLICY}
The theories produced should be checked by the theory design tools
of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD035}, against the theory design provided.
This is done in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/MDT045}.
There are no functions to be checked.
