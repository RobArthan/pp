\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains detailed designs
for the theories ``sum'', ``one'' and ``combin'',
called for in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/HLD011}.
The design is implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP045}.

\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains the detailed design for the theories ``basic$\_$hol'', ``sum'', ``one'', ``combin'', ``hol''.

These respectively:
\begin{description}
\item [basic$\_$hol]
This theory is the minimum theory in which consistency can be
guaranteed, due to primitive inference rules requiring
the presence of certain types and constants that are
not all present until this point.
The theory itself is empty.
\item [sum]
Define the sum type (i.e. binary disjoint union).
\item [one]
Defines a one-point type.
\item [combin]
Defines the combinators $CombS$, $CombK$ and $CombI$
and the functional composition operator $o$.
\item [hol]
This theory will be the starting theory for a user that wants access to
all the ICL supplied theories.
The theory itself is empty.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This document depends on \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP040}, which is the theory of characters,
and the theory design tools of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD035}.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}
None known.
\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
The three inhabited theories are missing some already obvious theorem
members, and it may be appropriate to add others 
as development and application work progresses.

\section{THE THEORY ``basic$\_$hol''}
\subsection{Design of the theory ``basic$\_$hol''}
=THDOC
req_name "basic_hol" (Value "char");
=DESCRIBE
The theory ``€basic$\_$hol›'' is the minimum theory in which consistency can be
guaranteed, due to primitive inference rules requiring
the precsence of certain types and constants that are
not all present until this point.
The theory itself is empty.
=ENDDOC

val basic_hol_success = theory_check_success ();
initialise_td_results ();
=TEX
=DOC
signature €BasicHolTheory› = sig
end;
=DESCRIBE
This is the signature in which we declare theory ``basic$\_$hol''.
The theory itself is empty.

\section{THE THEORY ``one''}
\subsection{Design of the theory ``one''}
=THDOC
req_name "one" (Value "basic_hol");
=DESCRIBE
The theory ``€one›'' defines a one-point type, $îONEÆ$.
=ENDDOC
=THDOC
req_const ("IsOneRep",îBOOL ≠ BOOLÆ);
req_defn (["IsOneRep","is_one_rep_def"],([],¨∂ one: BOOL∑ 
	µ x: BOOL∑ IsOneRep x § (x § one)Æ));
=DESCRIBE
We represent the type $ONE$ by a single member of type $îBOOLÆ$, expressed
by the predicate HOL constant $¨€IsOneRep›Æ$.
=ENDDOC
=THDOC
req_type ("ONE",0);
req_defn(["ONE","one_def1"],([],¨∂ f: ONE ≠ BOOL ∑ TypeDefn IsOneRep fÆ));
req_const("One",îONEÆ);
req_defn(["One","one_def"],([],¨µ x: ONE∑ x = OneÆ));
=DESCRIBE
The type $€ONE›$ has only one member,$¨€One›Æ$, demonstrated by its definition ``$€One›$''
(which is bound to the ML value $one\_def$).
The definition of the type is saved with key ``€ONE›''.
=ENDDOC
=THDOC
req_thm("one_fns_thm",([],¨µ f: 'a ≠ ONE ∑ f = Ã x ∑ OneÆ));
=DESCRIBE
The theorem ``$€one\_fns\_thm›$'' states that there is only one
function of any given domain whose range is $îONEÆ$.
=ENDDOC
Red tape to end theory design:

\subsection{Signature of the theory ``one''}
=DOC
signature €OneTheory› = sig
	val €is_one_rep_def› : THM;
	val €one_def› : THM;
	val €one_def1› : THM;
	val €one_fns_thm› : THM;
end;

$one\_def$ is the definition of $One$, saved with the key ``One'',$one\_def1$ is the type definition of $ONE$, saved with the key ``ONE''.
.
$one\_fns\_thm$ is the theorem saved with key ``$one\_fns\_thm$''.
=ENDDOC
\section{THE THEORY ``combin''}
\subsection{Design of the theory ``combin''}
=THDOC
req_name "combin" (Value "basic_hol");
=DESCRIBE
The theory ``€combin›'' defines the combinators $CombS$, $CombK$ and $CombI$
and the functional composition operator $o$.
=ENDDOC
If a user intends to make significant use of the combinators
they may wish to alias $Comb$ to $S$, etc.
The combinators are not given their usual one letter names to preserve 
these for use as variable names.
=THDOC
req_const ("o",î('b ≠ 'c) ≠ ('a ≠ 'b) ≠ ('a  ≠ 'c)Æ);
req_infix (300, "o");
req_defn(["o","o_def"],([],¨µ (f:'b ≠ 'c) (g:'a ≠ 'b) (x: 'a) ∑
	(f o g) x = f(g x)Æ));
=DESCRIBE
The HOL constant ``$€o›$'' represents functional composition,
and is given a definition saved under key ``€o›''.
=ENDDOC
Note that ``o'' is lower case, following literature conventions.
=THDOC
req_const ("CombS",î('a ≠ 'b ≠ 'c) ≠ ('a ≠ 'b) ≠ 'a ≠ 'cÆ);
req_const ("CombK",î'a ≠ 'b ≠ 'aÆ);
req_const ("CombI",î'a ≠ 'aÆ);
req_defn(["CombS","comb_s_def"],([],¨µ (f:'a ≠ 'b ≠ 'c) (g:'a ≠ 'b) (x:'a) ∑
	CombS f g x = f x (g x)Æ));
req_defn(["CombK","comb_k_def"],([],¨µ (x : 'a) (y : 'b) ∑ CombK x y = xÆ));
req_defn(["CombI","comb_i_def"],([],¨µ (x : 'a) ∑ CombI x = xÆ));
=DESCRIBE
The HOL constant $¨€CombS›Æ$ is the duplication combinator,
$¨€CombK›Æ$ is the deletion combinator,
and $¨€CombI›Æ$ is the identity combinator.
Their definitions are saved under the keys ``€CombS›'', ``€CombK›'' and ``€CombI›''.
=ENDDOC
=THDOC
req_thm("s_k_thm",([],¨µ x ∑ 
	(CombS:('a ≠ 'b ≠ 'a) ≠ ('a ≠ 'b) ≠ 'a ≠ 'a) CombK x = CombIÆ));
req_thm("o_assoc_thm",([],¨µ (f:'a ≠ 'b) (g:'c ≠ 'a) (h :'d ≠ 'c)∑ 
	f o (g o h) = (f o g) o hÆ));
req_thm("o_i_thm",([],¨µ f : 'a ≠ 'b∑
	((CombI o f) = f) ± ((f o CombI) = f)Æ));
=DESCRIBE
The theorem ``$€s\_k\_thm›$'' expresses the relationship between $S$, $K$ and $I$.
The theorem ``$€o\_assoc\_thm›$'' expresses the associativity of
functional composition.
The theorem ``$€o\_i\_thm›$'' expresses the fact that $I$ is the left and right identity of $o$.

\subsection{Signature of the theory ``combin''}
=DOC
signature €CombinTheory› = sig
	val €comb_s_def› : THM;
	val €comb_k_def› : THM;
	val €comb_i_def› : THM;
	val €o_def› : THM;
	val €o_assoc_thm› : THM;
	val €o_i_thm› : THM;
end;
=DESCRIBE
In the signature of $CombinTheory$ in which we declare theory ``combin'' we bind the definitions of $CombS$, $CombK$, $CombI$ and $o$ to
$comb\_s\_def$, $comb\_k\_def$, $comb\_i\_def$ and $o\_def$ respectively.
The theorem  saved with key ``$o\_assoc\_thm$'' is bound to
the ML value of the same name, as is ``$o\_i\_thm$''.
=ENDDOC
We do not bind the other theorems of ``combin'' to ML values
because they won't be in common use.
\section{THE THEORY ``sum''}
\subsection{Design of the theory ``sum''}
=THDOC
req_name "sum" (Value "combin");
=DESCRIBE
The theory ``€sum›'' defines the sum type (i.e. binary disjoint union).
=ENDDOC
=THDOC

	(IsSumRep z ¥ (isl z § inl(outl z) = z)) ±
	(IsSumRep z ¥ (isr z § inr(outr z) = z))
	Æ));
=DESCRIBE
The representation of a value of type $î'a\ +\ 'bÆ$ is 
by a triple, where in the implementation the third member indicates whether
the first or second member is the ``real'' value of the type.
This is expressed by the constant $€IsSumRep›$ whose definition
is saved with key ``€IsSumRep›''.
=ENDDOC
=THDOC
req_type ("+",2);
req_infix (300,"+");
req_defn(["+","sum_def"],([],¨∂ f: 'a + 'b ≠ ('a ∏ 'b ∏ BOOL) ∑ TypeDefn IsSumRep fÆ));

	([],¨µ (x1:'a) (x2:'a) (y1:'b) (y2:'b) (z: 'a + 'b) ∑
	(InL(OutL z) = z ≤ InR(OutR z) = z) ±

	(IsL z § InL(OutL z) = z) ±
	(IsR z § InR(OutR z) = z)
	Æ));
=DESCRIBE
The HOL constants $€InL›$ and $€InR›$ are the left and right injection
functions for sum types,
$€OutL›$ and $€OutR›$ are the left and right destructor
functions for sum types, and
$€IsL›$ and $€IsR›$ are the left and right discriminator
functions.
The resulting definition is also the
primary rewrite rule for these functions,
and is bound to the ML variable $sum\_clauses$(q.v).
=ENDDOC
=THDOC
req_thm("sum_cases_thm",([],
	¨µ z:'a + 'b ∑ InL (OutL z) = z ≤ InR (OutR z) = zÆ));
=DESCRIBE
The theorem ``$€sum\_cases\_thm›$'' just extracts
the first clause of $sum\_clauses$.
It is used in conjunction with, e.g., $≤\_THEN$.
=ENDDOC
=THDOC
req_thm("sum_fns_thm",([],
	¨µ (f: 'a ≠ 'c) (g: 'b ≠ 'c) ∑
	∂â1 h: 'a + 'b ≠ 'c ∑
	h o InL = f ± h o InR = gÆ));
=DESCRIBE
The theorem ``$€sum\_fns\_thm›$'' may be used for providing 
meta-results over $InL$ and $InR$,
and is bound to the ML value $sum\_fns\_thm$.

\section{THE THEORY ``hol''}
\subsection{Design of the theory ``hol''}
=THDOC
req_name "hol" (Value "one");
req_parent "sum";
req_parent "sets";
=DESCRIBE
The theory ``€hol›'' is the ``top'' theory of the
supplied ICL HOL system,
in which all supplied theories are ancestors.
The theory itself is empty.
=ENDDOC
Theories created after the introduction of this document
and its implementation into the build will be inserted 
``below'' this theory using $new\_parent$.

Red tape to end theory design:

\section{TEST POLICY}
The theories produced should be checked by the theory design tools
of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD035}, against the theory design provided.
This is done in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/MDT045}.
There are no functions to be checked.
