\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document contains a detailed design for the 
tools that support the production of theory designs.
The tools and techniques described should be used
to document all ICL supplied theories.
However, the tools do not form part of a release of ICL HOL.
The design is
implemented in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP035}.
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose and Background}
This document contains a detailed design for the
tools that support the production of theory designs.
In addition, it describes how these tools are to be used.
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
This document depends on the presence of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/IMP020}.
\subsubsection{Deficiencies}

\subsubsection{Possible Enhancements}
A method of displaying the required ``theory'',
or some other fuller item than just $summarize\-\_td\-\_results$.
\newpage
\section{DISCUSSION}
A design of a theory should, when complete, define exactly what
is present in a given theory.
When providing user documentation this ``presence'' includes the
associated tactics, conversions, etc, dedicated to handling
constructs introduced by the theory.
However for the purposes of this document we are only 
interested in items accessed from the theory database by
the interface functions of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD012}.
Indeed, we are also interested in only specific portions of the user data (from $get\-\_user\-\_datum$)
of a theory, as well as not being interested in its ancestors (as opposed to parents), its children, or its status.

We do not adopt the alternative requirement (to exact definition), which is for the design to demand merely that those
things stated in the design be present, thus allowing 
additional things. This seems unreasonably liberal, and encourages
unnecessary clutter.
However, when the specification tools of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD046} are used,
there is little point in giving a separate ``design'' for constants
defined with $const\_spec$, since that already gives a purely declarative
interface. Consequently, an option is provided to suppress checks on parts
of the theory other than the theorems. 

Given a theory design, we wish to be able to automatically check that the design type checks and that a particular theory satisfies the design.
We choose to do this by introducing a ``=THDOC'' keyword
and declaring a ``thydoc'' option for $sieve$
in the standard sievefile.
This keyword acts in a similar manner to ``=DOC'', but the
information box is considered as not for the user's consumption, and is for extraction only with the ``thydoc'' or ``tex'' filters, and in particular not with the ``sml'' filter.
We also provide a ``=THSML'' keyword, corresponding to ``=SML'' but only seen in $tex$ and $thydoc$ screen views.

An alternative to the ``=THDOC'' approach would have been to introduce one new
keyword per kind of object in a theory.
This would allow for a tidier presentation, but at additional
implementation and document processing costs.

Complimenting ``=THDOC'' is the provision of a set
of functions prefixed with $req\_$: e.g. $req\_const$ and $req\_axiom$.
These ``require functions'' have one of two effects, depending on the
value of the flag $req\_flag$.
In ``declare'' mode they will do sufficient work to create a theory in which all subsequent $req\_$ functions will evaluate successfully, using $new\_const$ and $new\_type$ to allow successful parsing.
This mode allows a design to be type-checked,
without having to create a theory implementation.

In ``check'' mode the $req\_$ functions indicate that their argument must be
present in the theory being checked, and that nothing else
must be in the theory other than those things noted by the sum of the $req\_$ functions used.
\section{METHOD OF USE}
The implementor will first create a detailed design (``dtd'' sequence) document,
containing both a function design, that may be 
processed to give some structure signatures,
and a theory design. The theory design will consist either of
$req\_$ function calls for every object in the theory, or of
$req\_$ calls for the theorems in the theory together with a specification
of the other aspects of the theory
in the style supported by the specification tools of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD046}.
In this latter case, the flag $tc\_thms\_only$ should be set true to
suppress the checks on things other than theorems.

The pieces of the theory design may be given mingled with
the signature declaration, as the two are extracted separately.
The theory design is constrained to declare its name before any other declarations, and declare parents, types and constants
before their use in terms that require parsing, but otherwise the ordering
chosen does not in turn constrain the order of implementation.
For a running example let us assume the design document we start with
is  ``dtd123.doc''.

Using ``docsml'' the implementor may extract the signature
and error messages into a file called ``dtd123.sml'' which may be checked by loading into
Standard ML.
Then, using ``doc4tds'' the implementor may extract the theory design, with lines indicating $req\_flag$ set to ``declare'' mode, and loading the theory design support tools.
This  produces a ``dtd123.tds'' file which also may be checked by loading into
Standard ML, separately from the ``dtd123.sml'' file.

The implementor then produces an implementation (``imp'' sequence) document, ``imp123.doc''.
From this they produce a ``imp123.sml'' file using ``docsml''.
This is checked against the design's signature by 
first loading ``dtd123.sml'' and then ``imp123.sml''.

They then produce a theory check file from the 
detailed design document, using ``doctch'',
producing the file ``dtd123.tch''.
This has lines indicating $req\_flag$ set to ``check'' mode, and that the theory design support tools should be loaded,
and that a description and summary of the results
of the check should be made.
The check is made by loading ``dtd123.sml'', ``imp123.sml'' and then ``dtd123.tch'', and examining the log
of the load of ``dtd123.tch'' to see if it gave any complaint.

The implementor then produces a module test ($mdt$ sequence) document, $mdt123.doc$.
A request to load ``dtd123.tch'' will be embedded in
this file.
In addition, the theory support tools will provide a 
function $theory\-\_check\-\_success$ that returns $true$ or $false$ depending on the
success of the check, and after the loading of the ``.tch'' document the module test document should,
if it is using the material from \cite{DS/FMU/IED/DTD013},
contain the lines:
=GFT
store_mt_results[("theory check",
	theory_check_success,
	(),
	true)];
=TEX
This ensures that the module test summary records the 
success of the theory check.
The author of a module test document is strongly advised to
make the theory check as the last module test, so that the theory design check
summary is close to the end of the log of the main module test.

Having two (rather than one) additional document strippers has the advantage that ``wrapping'' clutter need not occur in the 
the detailed design documents,
nor need a check involve more than a just a single $use\-\_file$ command.
\section{EXAMPLE OF USE}

the type of pairs: the actual theory is somewhat different.

\section{THE SUPPORT TOOLS}
=DOC
signature ÛTheoryDesignSupportÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
This signature contains the tools for declaring
and checking a theory design.
=FAILURE
35001	Theory name not declared
=FAILUREC
The theory design tools in ``declare'' mode must
be given a new theory name by $req\_name$ to work in before
any other $req\_$ functions are used.
In ``check'' mode they must be informed of a theory to
check against before other $req\_$ functions can do anything.
The error message 35001 indicates that one of these requirements
have not been met.
=ENDDOC
\subsection{Starting and Stopping}
=DOC
datatype MODE = Declare | Check;
val Ûreq_flagÝ : MODE ref;
=DESCRIBE
This sets whether the theory design tools are in ``declare mode'' ($Declare$) and ``check mode'' ($Check$).
It should be set before  a call to $initialise\_td\_results$
(q.v.).
The default is ``check mode''.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
(* tc_thms_only		- flag, default false; *)
=DESCRIBE
If this flag is false all of the supported theory design checks are made. If it
is true then only the theorems in the theory will be checked.
The $req\_$ functions other than $req\_thm$ and $req\_name$
give rise to the following comment message if this flag is true.
=FAILURE
35101	?0 has no effect when the flag tc_thms_only is true
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûinitialise_td_resultsÝ : unit  -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This function initialises the process of either type-checking a theory design, or checking a theory implementation
against a design.
If $req\_flag$ (q.v.) is $Declare$ then it is in ``declare'' mode, and the purpose of the following processing is to type check the theory design.
If $Check$ then it is in ``check'' mode, and the purpose of the following processing is to check that the design
and implementation match.
The ``require functions'' are called in the same manner for both modes.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûsummarize_td_resultsÝ : unit -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This function is only useful in ``check'' mode, and 
executes the check that the theory components so far 
declared match the implementation.
It informs the user of mismatches by side-effect, rather
than failure.
In ``declare'' mode it will complain about those things
not saved on the theory by the require functions
(e.g. theorems), and otherwise remain quiet.

=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûtheory_check_successÝ : unit -> bool;
=DESCRIBE
This function returns true if in ``check'' mode and
the design matchs the implementation.
It always returns $true$ in ``declare'' mode, as in this
mode we only want to avoid an exception being raised: no more.

\subsection{Require Functions}
Each of the following functions mirror some
theory declaration mechanisms, and will have, where
appropriate, the same arguments as those functions.
Thus the meaning of the arguments to the functions below should usually be
determined by seeing the description of the functions reflected.

Apart from error 35001 (``Theory name not declared''),
and 35030 (``Cannot open required theory'')
the $req\_$ functions should not give rise to errors
in ``check'' mode, though, for instance, if their arguments are parsed then their parsing may give parse errors.
=DOC
val Ûreq_nameÝ : string -> string OPT -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$req\_name$ $tname$ $(Value$ $parent)$ declares the name of the theory being declared or checked.
In ``declare'' mode the 
function will open the theory $parent$,
and then the named theory, $tname$ will be used
as an argument to $new\_theory$ (q.v.), to give a ``clean''
area to attempt the declarations.
In ``check'' mode $tname$ will be used as an argument to
$open\_theory$ (q.v), and $parent$ added to the list of
declared parents.

The $parent$ argument is optional to allow the 
design of $min$, the only theory without a parent, to be made.
If the $parent$ argument is $Nil$ $req\_name$ will just attempt
to open the named theory, as $req\_name$ cannot create an 
initially parentless theory.
Apart from this case it is not possible to type-check the design of a theory
that is already present in the theory database.

This function must be called before any other $declare$ function
(otherwise they will give error message 35001), and may not be called more than once.
=FAILURE
35018	Cannot open parent theory ?0
35019	Cannot create a new theory ?0
35020	A theory name, which is ?0, has already been declared
35030	Cannot open required theory ?0
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûreq_languageÝ : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This requires the theory to have a particular language.
If not otherwise required the language defaults to being ``HOL''.
In ``declare'' mode the language is set as the language of the theory.
=FAILURE
35037	A language, ?0, has already been required
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûreq_parentÝ : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This declares the name of a parent to the theory.
In ``declare'' mode this will cause a call to $new\_parent$(q.v.).
Note that $req\_name$ declares an initial parent:
no additional call to $req\_parent$ should be made
for this parent name.
=FAILURE
35021	Cannot make ?0 a parent
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûreq_constÝ : (string * TYPE) -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This declares the name and type of a constant.
In ``declare'' mode this will cause a call to $new\_const$ (q.v).
=FAILURE
35022	Cannot make ?0 a constant
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûreq_typeÝ : (string * int) -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This declares the name and type of a type.
In ``declare'' mode this will cause a call to $new\_type$ (q.v).
=FAILURE
35038	Cannot make ?0 a type
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûreq_axiomÝ : (string list * SEQ) -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
$req\_axiom$ declares the keys and sequent of an axiom.
In ``declare'' mode this will check for duplication of keys:
summarize\_td\_results will manifest warnings of duplication
in ``check'' mode.
=FAILURE
35023	Key ?0 already required for an axiom
35039	List of names may not be empty
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûreq_defnÝ : (string list * SEQ) -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This declares the keys and sequent of a definition.
This function should be used for specifications and type definitions,
as well as ``simple'' definitions.
In ``declare'' mode this will check for duplication of keys:
summarize\_td\_results will manifest warnings of duplication
in ``check'' mode.
=FAILURE
35024	Key ?0 already required for a definition
35039	List of names may not be empty
35040	A definition does not contain free variables, but ?0 ?1 free in sequent
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûreq_thmÝ : (string * SEQ) -> unit;
val Ûlist_req_thmÝ : (string list * SEQ) -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This declares the key and sequent of a theorem.
In ``declare'' mode this will check for duplication of keys:
summarize\_td\_results will manifest warnings of duplication
in ``check'' mode.
$list\_req\_thm$ is used when a theorem is to be saved under 
more than one name.
=FAILURE
35025	Key ?0 already required for a theorem
35039	List of names may not be empty
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûreq_consistency_thmÝ : TERM -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This is concerned with the theorem which discharges the consistency conjecture
for a constant introduced with $const\_spec$.
In ``declare'' mode it just checks that the argument is a constant
and that the theorem
returned by $get\_spec$ for this constant does have an assumption
(which is the consistency conjecture).
In ``check'' mode it also checks that the consistency conjecture has indeed been
proved and saved under the name following the conventions used
by $get\_spec$.

=FAILURE
35102	?0 is not a constant
35103	?0 does not have a consistency conjecture
35104	get_spec returned a theorem for ?0 with more than one assumption
=FAILUREC
Error 35104 is reported with $error$ rather than $fail$ because it indicates
a problem in $get\_spec$ rather than in the argument to this function.
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûreq_binderÝ : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This declares the name to have binder status.
In ``declare'' mode this makes a call to $declare\_binder$ (q.v), and will $pass\_on$(q.v) any error messages.
=FAILURE
35027	Name ?0 already required to have a fixity status
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûreq_infixÝ : (int * string) -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This declares the name to have infix status with
the noted precedence.
In ``declare'' mode this makes a call to $declare\_infix$ (q.v), and will $pass\_on$(q.v) any error messages.
=FAILURE
35027	Name ?0 already required to have a fixity status
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûreq_nonfixÝ : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This declares the name to have its fixity
status from an ancestor theory suppressed (``undeclared'') in
this theory.
It should not be used on names with previously unset fixity.
In ``declare'' mode this makes a call to $declare\_nonfix$ (q.v.), and will $pass\_on$(q.v) any error messages.
By default any name not required to have a fixity status has an undeclared fixity status (is ``nonfix'' in some sense).
=FAILURE
20203	There is no fixity declaration for ?0 in the current context
35027	Name ?0 already required to have a fixity status
=ENDDOC
=DOC

the noted precedence.
In ``declare'' mode this makes a call to $declare\_prefix$ (q.v.), and will $pass\_on$(q.v) any error messages.
=FAILURE
35027	Name ?0 already required to have a fixity status
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûreq_postfixÝ : (int * string) -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This declares the name to have postfix status with
the noted precedence.
In ``declare'' mode this makes a call to $declare\_postfix$ (q.v), and will $pass\_on$(q.v) any error messages.
=FAILURE
35027	Name ?0 already required to have a fixity status
=ENDDOC

val Ûreq_terminatorÝ : string -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This declares the name to be a terminator.
In ``declare'' mode this makes a call to $declare\_terminator$ (q.v), and will $pass\_on$(q.v) any error messages.
Anything not declared to be a terminator is a non-terminator.
=FAILURE
35028	Name ?0 already required to be a terminator
20101	The string ?0 is not a valid terminator. Terminators must start
	with a symbolic character, must not contain spaces,
	and must not end with underscore, %%up%% or %%down%%
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûreq_aliasÝ : (string * TERM) -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This declares the name to be an alias for the given constant.
In ``declare'' mode this makes a call to $declare\_alias$ (q.v).
=FAILURE
20301	The term ?0 is not a constant
20305	The constant ?0 is not in scope
=ENDDOC
=DOC
val Ûreq_type_abbrevÝ : (string * string list * TYPE) -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This declares the name to be a type abbreviation for the given type.
In ``declare'' mode this makes a call to $declare\_type\_abbrev$ (q.v), and will $pass\_on$(q.v) any error messages.
=FAILURE
35029	Name ?0 already required to be a type abbreviation
20402	The identifier ?0 is already declared as a type constructor
