\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}

This document provides documentation, a makefile and auxiliary scripts
for the process of producing certain example databases.
It is based on \cite{DS/FMU/IED/WRK027}.

\subsection{Introduction}

This document contains the literate script of a makefile and a number
of auxiliary files which are scripts for other programs.  To produce
the makefile the program {\tt sieve} is run against this document,
with the {\tt sml} view, as shown below.  The  output is the makefile,
together with a number of small utility-files: mostly scripts for {\tt
sed} and {\tt awk}.

The commentary upon the makefile assumes some knowledge of
the UNIX make command.
The key item of knowledge is the form and meaning of a standard
makefile entry.
=GFT Example makefile entry
target1 target2 : dependency1 dependency2 dependency3
	command1
	command2
	command3
	command4
=TEX
To use such an entry in a makefile the user might type:
=GFT csh 
make -f makefile target1
=TEX
If so, $make$ will first recursively use the rest of the makefile to
do what processing is necessary for each of the $dependency_i$
(this may be nothing).
It will then determine whether $target1$ exists and has a ``time of last change''
after the ``time of last change'' of each
$dependency_i$.
If so $make$ will halt.
If not, then it will execute each of the $command_i$ in sequence,
in different shells, and then halt.

See UNIX documentation for further details, such as a description of macros and pattern matching rules.

It is this algorithm, in combination with a single file (a database) containing all the effect of cumulative loads
in \Product{}, that leads to the system of ``flags'' in the entires below.
\subsection{Interface}

The makefile is saved as file {\tt wrk051.mkf}.
Having produced the makefile ( {\tt wrk051.mkf}) and utilities,
as above, there are then several options for further commands.

To print this document:
\begin{quote}
\tt
make -f wrk051.mkf wrk051.prt
\end{quote}

To run tutorial scripts for usr004:
\begin{quote}
\tt
make -f wrk051.mkf usr004.tutorial
\end{quote}
Similiarly for $usr011$, $usr022$ and $usr023$, rather than $usr004$.

To run exercise scripts for usr011 (which will also run the tutorial scripts for $usr011$, if not already done):
\begin{quote}
\tt
make -f wrk051.mkf usr011.zexercises
\end{quote}

To run solutions scripts for usr011 (which will also run the exercises, if not already done):
\begin{quote}
\tt
make -f wrk051.mkf usr011.solutions
\end{quote}

To tidy up afterwards, execute:

\begin{quote}
\tt
make -f wrk051.mkf texclean clean_examples
\end{quote}

To remove all auxiliary files created by ``sieving'' this one:
\begin{quote}
\tt
rm -f wrk051.mkf wrk051_*.*
\end{quote}

\section{PRELIMINARIES}

\subsection{Macros}
The following should be left unchanged:
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf
ARCH:sh = arch
=TEX

Thefollowing may be altered on the command line that invokes {\tt make}.
The first fixes the machine architecture.
The next two define the location of the appropriate parent databses.
They assume that $INSTALLDIR$ is set in the shell environment.
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf
ARCH:sh = arch

PP_HOLDB = $(INSTALLDIR)/$(ARCH)pp_hol.db
PP_ZEDDB = $(INSTALLDIR)/$(ARCH)pp_zed.db

EHOLROOT = example_hol
EZEDROOT = example_zed
=TEX

The following should be left unchanged:
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf
EHOLDB = $(ARCH)$(EHOLROOT).db
EZEDDB = $(ARCH)$(EZEDROOT).db
=TEX

\subsection{Default}
The default action is to print a message:
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf
default :
	@echo Use:
	@echo \t make -f wrk051.mkf all
	@echo to create example ProofPower databases for HOL and Z. 
	@echo See document DS/FMU/IED/WRK051 for details
	exit 1
=TEX
\subsection{Pattern Matching Rules} \label{PatternMatchingRules}
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf

.SUFFIXES: .doc .sml .tex .dvi .tch .prt
%.tex: %.doc
	doctex $*

%.tch: %.doc  dtd035.sml imp035.sml
	doctch $*

%.dvi: %.tex
	texdvi $*
	- bibtex $*
	texdvi $*
	texdvi $*

%.sml: %.doc
	docsml $*

%.prt: %.dvi
	pstex $*
=TEX
The following .sml files are supplied to the user directly, rather than their
source documents being given.
However, if the documents happen to be present, and the $.sml$ files not, the following
will create the $.sml$ files.
Notice that it does not update the $.sml$ files if the
matching $.doc$ files are changed.
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf
€usr011A.sml› \
€usr011B.sml› \
€usr011C.sml› \
€usr011D.sml› \
€usr011E.sml› \
€usr011T.sml›:
	if test -f $*.doc ; \
	then
		docsml $*
	fi
=TEX

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{PREPARING CLEAN DATABASES}
The following assumes that suitable parent databases can be
found in the directory pointed to by shell variable
$INSTALLDIR$.
The example databases are files whose names are held in
the macros
=INLINEFT
$(EHOLDB)
=TEX
{} and {}
=INLINEFT
$(EZEDDB)
=TEX
{}.
The two flags, $wrk051\_hol.flag$ and $wrk051\_zed.flag$
are two empty files, whose ``time of last change'' is the
time of creation of the example databases.
Various items later in this makefile have these flags
amongst their dependencies.
This means that, amongst other reasons for reloading,
such items are reloaded if their previous load
was made prior to the creation of the appropriate
example database.
If the dependencies of these items were the database
filenames themselves, then a reload would be needed
on any change to the databases, such as another, orthogonal, load.
However, the databases themselves will still be recreated
if the flags are used as dependencies when they are out of
step with their parents (or are not their at all!).
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf
€wrk051_hol.flag› \
$(EHOLDB) : $(PP_HOLDB)
	pp_make_database -p $(PP_HOLDB) $(EHOLROOT)
	touch wrk051_hol.flag

€wrk051_zed.flag› \
$(EZEDDB) : $(PP_ZEDDB)
	pp_make_database -p $(PP_ZEDDB) $(EZEDROOT)
	touch wrk051_zed.flag
=TEX

The following is piped into a session after all desired
``-i'' files have been entered: 
=VDUMP wrk051_save_and_quit.sml
(* created from wrk051.doc %Z% $Revision$ $RCSfile$ $Date$ *)
save_and_quit();
=TEX

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{MAKING THE TUTORIAL MANUAL (usr004)}
The following pattern of file creation and makefile entry
is used in most of the following sections, though we only comment
upon it in this one.

The following command creates a file:
=INLINEFT
wrk051_delete_theories_usr004.sml
=TEX
{} that is used to delete, if present, the theories about
to be created.
If no deletion took place the load of $usr004.sml$ would fail.
A similar file is created for each of the items that may be added
into the example databases.
=VDUMP wrk051_delete_theories_usr004.sml
(* created from wrk051.doc %Z% $Revision$ $RCSfile$ $Date$ *)
(force_delete_theory "Peanissimo" handle Fail _ => ());
(force_delete_theory "ordinals" handle Fail _ => ());
=TEX

The following creates, if necessary, an example HOL database (via
=INLINEFT
wrk051_hol.flag
=TEX
{}.
It then creates an $.sml$ file from the $.doc$,
loads the above theory deleting file into the example database, and then loads the formal text of $usr004.doc$.
It then saves the database with the results of the above loads.
Finally, it touches a flag, $usr004.tutorial$, so that
the ``time of last change'' for the flag is the time
of last loading $usr004.sml$.
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf
€usr004.tutorial›: wrk051_hol.flag usr004.doc usr004.sml
	hol -d $(EHOLDB) -i wrk051_delete_theories_usr004 -i usr004 < wrk051_save_and_quit.sml
	touch usr004.tutorial
=TEX
