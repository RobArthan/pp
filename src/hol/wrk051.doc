\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}

This document provides documentation, a makefile and auxiliary scripts
for the process of producing certain example databases
for a \Product{} user.

\subsection{Introduction}

This document contains the literate script of a makefile ($wrk051.mkf$) and
a number of auxiliary files which are scripts for other programs.  This
material allows the creation of example databases containing \Product{}
tutorial and case study material.  The user's interface to this material
is given in section
\ref{INTERFACE}.

To produce
the makefile the program {\tt sieve} is used to process this document,
with the {\tt sml} option.  The  result is the creation of a makefile,
together with a number of small utility-files that are inputs for
\Product{}.  Most the the makefile entries are concerned with the creation
or updating of various example databases.

The commentary upon the makefile assumes some knowledge of the UNIX
{\tt make} command.  The key item of knowledge is the form and meaning
of a standard makefile entry.
=GFT Example makefile entry
target1 target2 : dependency1 dependency2 dependency3
	command1
	command2
	command3
	command4
=TEX
To use such an entry in a makefile the user might type:
=GFT csh 
make -f makefile target1
=TEX
If so, {\tt make} will first recursively use the rest of the makefile to
do what processing is necessary for each of the $dependency_i$ (this may
be nothing).  It will then determine whether $target1$ exists and has a
``time of last change'' after the ``time of last change'' of each
$dependency_i$.  If so {\tt make} will halt.  If not, then it will execute
each of the $command_i$ in sequence, in different shells, and then halt.

It is the above {\tt make} algorithm, in combination with a single file (a
database) containing all the effect of cumulative loads in \Product{}, that leads to the system of ``flags'' in the makefile entries in section
\ref{FIRSTFLAG} and beyond.

See UNIX documentation\cite{sunOS4.1manuals} for further details, such as
a description of macros and pattern matching rules.

\subsection{Interface}
\label{INTERFACE}
In the following descriptions the text marked by:
=GFT csh
marked text
=TEX
may be cut and pasted without change from the source file of this document
(wrk051.doc) into a SunView shell tool or command tool.

To produce the example databases, start in a directory with the necessary
files of:
=GFT
(1)     usr004.doc
(2)     usr011A.doc usr011B.doc usr011C.doc usr011D.doc
(3)     usr011E.doc usr011T.doc usr011S.doc usr011X.doc
(4)     usr013A.doc usr013B.doc usr013C.doc usr013D.doc usr013E.doc
(5)     usr013F.doc usr013G.doc usr013H.doc usr013S.doc usr013X.doc
(6)     usr022_slides.doc usr023_slides.doc 
(7)     wrk022.doc wrk043.doc wrk044.doc
(8)     wrk051.doc (this file)
=TEX
These should all be present in the subdirectory $docs$ of the \Product{}
installation directory.  However, it is better to work with copies of
these files,  in a new directory, e.g. $examples$.  If using a \Product{}
installation made in the manner suggested in \cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR007} then
copies may be made by:
=GFT csh
cd $INSTALLDIR
mkdir examples
cd $INSTALLDIR/docs
cp usr004.doc  usr011A.doc usr011B.doc usr011C.doc usr011D.doc \
      usr011E.doc usr011T.doc usr011S.doc usr011X.doc \
      usr013A.doc usr013B.doc usr013C.doc usr013D.doc usr013E.doc \
      usr013F.doc usr013G.doc usr013H.doc usr013S.doc usr013X.doc \
      usr022_slides.doc usr023_slides.doc wrk022.doc wrk043.doc \
      wrk044.doc wrk051.doc $INSTALLDIR/examples
=TEX
We also need soft links to the two parent databases:
=GFT
(1)     `arch`pp_hol.db `arch`pp_zed.db
=TEX
These should be present in the subdirectory $`arch`bin$ of the \Product{}
installation directory.  We use soft links rather than copying them
becuase of their size and we don't need to write to them.
=GFT
ln -s $INSTALLDIR/`arch`bin/`arch`pp_hol.db $INSTALLDIR/examples
ln -s $INSTALLDIR/`arch`bin/`arch`pp_zed.db $INSTALLDIR/examples
=TEX
Then create the makefile {\tt wrk051.mkf} by :
=GFT csh
cd $INSTALLDIR/examples
sieve sml < wrk051.doc
=TEX
Having produced the makefile ( {\tt wrk051.mkf}) and utilities, as above,
there are then several options for further commands.

To print this document (assuming {\tt pstex} without arguments sends
output to the desired printer):
=GFT csh
make -f wrk051.mkf wrk051.prt
=TEX

To create a child \Product{} database containing the effect of loading the  tutorial scripts of usr004 \cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR004}:
=GFT csh
make -f wrk051.mkf usr004.tutorial
=TEX
The resulting database is called $`arch`example\_hol.db$, and can be
invoked by:
=GFT
hol -d example_hol
=TEX

Similarly for usr011\cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR011}, creating a database suitable
for loading the \ProductZ{} exercises and trying solutions for them,
by hand:
=GFT csh
make -f wrk051.mkf usr011.tutorial
=TEX
The resulting database is called $`arch`example\_zed.db$, and, assuming
a standard (i.e. not custom) installation, can be invoked by:
=GFT
zed -d example_zed
=TEX

Similarly for usr013\cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR013}, creating a database suitable
for loading the \ProductHOL{} exercises and trying solutions for them, by
hand:
=GFT csh
make -f wrk051.mkf usr013.tutorial
=TEX
The resulting database is called $`arch`example\_hol.db$, and, assuming a
standard (i.e. not custom) installation, can be invoked by:
=GFT
zed -d example_hol
=TEX

Similar entries also exist for $usr022$\cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR022} and
$usr023$\cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR023}, rather than $usr004$.
=GFT csh
make -f wrk051.mkf usr022.tutorial
make -f wrk051.mkf usr023.tutorial
=TEX

To create a database ($`arch`example\_zed.db$) containing the effect of
loading the exercise scripts for usr011 (which will also run the tutorial
scripts for $usr011$, if not already done):
=GFT csh
make -f wrk051.mkf usr011.zexercises
=TEX

To create a database ($`arch`example\_zed.db$) containing the effect of
loading the solutions scripts for usr011 (which will also run the
exercises, if not already done):
=GFT csh
make -f wrk051.mkf usr011.zsolutions
=TEX

To create a database ($`arch`example\_hol.db$) containing the effect of
loading the exercise scripts for usr013 (which will also run the tutorial
scripts for $usr013$, if not already done):
=GFT csh
make -f wrk051.mkf usr011.exercises
=TEX

To create a database ($`arch`example\_zed.db$) containing the effect of loading the solutions scripts for usr011 (which will also run the exercises, if not already done):
=GFT csh
make -f wrk051.mkf usr011.solutions
=TEX

To tidy up afterwards, deleting all created databases and files, execute:
=GFT csh
make -f wrk051.mkf clean_examples
=TEX

To remove all auxiliary files created by ``sieving'' this one:
=GFT csh
rm -f wrk051.mkf \
	wrk051_save_and_quit.sml \
	wrk051_delete_theories_usr004.sml \
	wrk051_delete_theories_usr011.sml \
	wrk051_delete_theories_zexercises.sml \
	wrk051_delete_theories_usr013.sml \
	wrk051_delete_theories_exercises.sml \
	wrk051_delete_theories_spc001.sml \
	wrk051_delete_theories_spc002.sml \
	wrk051_delete_theories_usr022.sml \
	wrk051_delete_theories_usr023.sml \
	wrk051_delete_theories_wrk022.sml \
	wrk051_delete_theories_wrk043.sml \
	wrk051_delete_theories_wrk044.sml \
	wrk051_delete_theories_wrk050.sml
=TEX

The file {\tt pp\_install}, to be found in the installation directory,
copies all the files needed into a new directory and runs all the
\Product{} scripts to generate the two databases ($`arch`example\_zed.db$)
and ($`arch`example\_hol.db$).  It copies these two databases into the
$`arch`bin$ directory, and cleans up afterwards.  This file needs to be
run from the release directory.

It is advised that the {\tt changeParent} command is run on the new databases,
the new parents being {\tt sun4pp\_hol.db} and {\tt sun4pp\_zed}, found
in the subdirectory {\tt sun4bin}.  The script {\tt pp\_install} does this.

\section{PRELIMINARIES}

\subsection{Macros}
The following should be left unchanged (it is the current
machine architecture):
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf
ARCH:sh = arch

=TEX

The following may be altered on the command line that invokes {\tt make}.  The
first gives the subdirectory in which the parent databases are to be found.  It
assumes the shell variable $INSTALLDIR$ is set to the release directory.  The
next two give the full pathnames for the appropriate parent databases.  The
last two define the ``root'' names of the example databases.
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf
DBDIR=$(INSTALLDIR)/$(ARCH)bin

PP_HOLDB = $(DBDIR)/$(ARCH)pp_hol.db
PP_ZEDDB = $(DBDIR)/$(ARCH)pp_zed.db

EHOLROOT = example_hol
EZEDROOT = example_zed

=TEX

The following should be left unchanged - they define the actual
file names of the example databases, and these must 
be precisely as given.
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf
EHOLDB = $(ARCH)$(EHOLROOT).db
EZEDDB = $(ARCH)$(EZEDROOT).db

=TEX

The following are the comments returned at the end of a successful or
failed  make:
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf
SUCCESS_MESSAGE = "make command succeeded"
FAILURE_MESSAGE = "make command failed"

=TEX

\subsection{Default}
The default action of the makefile is to print a message.
The default is indicated by it being the first target in the
makefile.
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf
default :
	@echo Use:
	@echo "         make -f wrk051.mkf all"
	@echo to create example ProofPower databases for HOL and Z. 
	@echo See document DS/FMU/IED/WRK051 for further details.

=TEX

\subsection{Pattern Matching Rules} \label{PatternMatchingRules}
See {\tt make} documentation for how the following work.  They provide
the ``standard'' processing rules for:
\begin{description}
\item[.doc -]

\item[.sml -]
Standard ML files, usually derived from documents,
\item[.tex -]
\LaTeX{} files derived from documents,
\item[.dvi -]
files displayable by {\tt dvipage} or printable by {\tt pstex},
\item[.prt -]
dummy files, used to invoke printing.
\end{description}

\section{PREPARING CLEAN DATABASES}
\label{FIRSTFLAG}
Unless the macro definitions previously given in this document have been
altered, the following assumes that suitable parent databases can be found
in the directory in which we are using this make file.  The example
databases are files whose names are held in the macros
=INLINEFT
$(EHOLDB)
=TEX
{} and {}
=INLINEFT
$(EZEDDB)
=TEX
{}.
The two flags, $wrk051\_hol.flag$ and $wrk051\_zed.flag$ are two empty
files, whose ``time of last change'' is the time of creation of the
example databases.  Various items later in this makefile have these flags
amongst their dependencies.  This means that, amongst other reasons for
reloading, such items are reloaded if their previous load was made prior
to the creation of the appropriate example database.  If the dependencies
of these items were the database filenames themselves, then a reload would
be needed on any change to the databases, such as another, orthogonal,
load.  However, the databases themselves will still be recreated if the
flags are used as dependencies when they are out of step with their parents
(or are not there at all!).
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf
€wrk051_hol.flag› $(EHOLDB) : $(PP_HOLDB)
	pp_make_database -p $(PP_HOLDB) $(EHOLROOT)
	touch wrk051_hol.flag

€wrk051_zed.flag› $(EZEDDB) : $(PP_ZEDDB)
	pp_make_database -p $(PP_ZEDDB) $(EZEDROOT)
	touch wrk051_zed.flag

=TEX

The following can be ``piped'' into a \Product{} session after all desired
``-i'' files have been entered - it will cause the effects of the previous
loads to be saved within the database.
=VDUMP wrk051_save_and_quit.sml
(* created from wrk051.doc %Z% $Revision$ $RCSfile$ $Date$ *)
save_and_quit();
=TEX

\section{MAKING THE TUTORIAL MANUAL (usr004)}
The following pattern of file creation and makefile entry is used in most
of the following sections, though we only comment upon it in this one.

The following command creates a file:
=INLINEFT
wrk051_delete_theories_usr004.sml
=TEX
{} that is used to delete, if present, the theories that would be created
by loading $usr004.sml$.  If the theories were present the load of
$usr004.sml$ would fail.  A similar file is created for each of the items
that may be added into the example databases.
=VDUMP wrk051_delete_theories_usr004.sml
(* created from wrk051.doc %Z% $Revision$ $RCSfile$ $Date$ *)
(force_delete_theory "Peanissimo" handle Fail _ => ());
(force_delete_theory "ordinals" handle Fail _ => ());
=TEX

The following creates, if necessary, an example HOL database (via
=INLINEFT
wrk051_hol.flag
=TEX
{}).
It then creates an $.sml$ file from $usr004.doc$, loads the above
theory-deleting file into the example database, and then loads this formal
text of $usr004.doc$.  It then saves the database with the results of the
above loads.  Finally, it touches a flag, $usr004.tutorial$, so that the
``time of last change'' for the flag is the time of last loading
$usr004.sml$.
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf
€usr004.tutorial›: wrk051_hol.flag usr004.doc usr004.sml
	hol -d $(EHOLDB) -i wrk051_delete_theories_usr004 \
		-i usr004 < wrk051_save_and_quit.sml

€all_zed›: usr011.zexercises wrk050.th

€all› : all_hol all_zed

=TEX

$all$ can be ``undone'' by $clean\_examples$.

\section{TIDYING UP THE FILE STORE}
Clean out all example database material that might be created during
an execution of this makefile:
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf
€clean_examples› :
	rm -f $(EHOLDB) $(EZEDDB) 
	rm -f wrk051_hol.flag wrk051_zed.flag

To remove all auxiliary files created by ``sieving'' {\tt wrk051.doc}
(we refrain from having a makefile entry delete its own makefile!):
=GFT csh
rm -f wrk051.mkf wrk051_*.*
=TEX
\section{make ENDINGS}
The following text causes {\tt make} to output the appropriate message
upon finished processing with either a successful or
failed ``make''.
=DUMPMORE wrk051.mkf
€.FAILED› :
	@ echo "*** $(FAILURE_MESSAGE) ***" 1>&2
	exit 1
